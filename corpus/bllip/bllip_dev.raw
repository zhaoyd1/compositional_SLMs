Ohio Edison Co. , seeking to lessen the financial impact of the Perry nuclear plant , said it completed a sale-leaseback transaction for a portion of its ownership in the plant .
Under the arrangement , the utility sold about 30 % of its stake in one of the northern Ohio plant 's two reactors -- the 1.2 million-kilowatt Unit 1 -- to a group of institutional investors led by Citicorp , a New York bank holding company .
Ohio Edison owns about 30 % of the unit .
Ohio Edison said the investors will pay it $ 509 million for the stake , then lease it back for 29 years at a rate estimated at 8.5 % to 9 % of the cash payment .

Ohio Edison 's outside auditors , citing uncertainties over whether the utility could recover the construction costs of the plant , qualified both its 1985 and 1986 financial statements .
Ohio Edison said the proceeds from the sale will finance the balance of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans incurred for the retirement of high-interest , long-term debt .
The utility added that it plans later this year to ask the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to allow it to recover the cost of Perry .
Ohio Edison said the transaction will allow the equity investors to take advantage of federal tax benefits .

Canrad Inc. expects declines in first-quarter net income and sales , but increases in the full year , according to Carl Krieger , chief executive officer .
For the current quarter , Canrad , a maker of microwave equipment and ultraviolet lamps and systems , projects net income of about $ 120,000 , or 10 cents a share , a 70 % decline from year-earlier net of $ 409,000 , or 34 cents a share , adjusted for a recent 5 % stock dividend .
Sales are expected to decrease about 8 % to $ 8.5 million from $ 9.2 million a year earlier .
A drop in incoming orders for its microwave-equipment products used in the telecommunications industry is the major reason for Canrad 's poor performance in the first quarter , Mr. Krieger said .
Microwave equipment is the company 's largest selling item as well as its most profitable , he noted .
Sales of the company 's two other major products -- ultraviolet lamps and motion picture projection equipment -- are ahead of previous estimates , he said .
In spite of the poor performance in the first quarter , Canrad expects overall earnings and sales for 1987 to be higher than the previous year .
Mr. Krieger forecasts that earnings will increase about 7 % to $ 1.6 million , or $ 1.40 a share , from $ 1.5 million , or $ 1.29 a share , in 1986 .
Sales are expected to increase about 10 % to $ 40 million from $ 36.6 million in 1986 .
Mr. Krieger said that microwave equipment sales should be sharply higher in the second and third quarters .

OKC Limited Partnership said a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a $ 21.5 million judgment against the company .
As reported last April , a federal district court in New Orleans ruled against OKC in a 1981 lawsuit filed by Aminoil USA Inc. , now part of Phillips Petroleum Co. .
The court ruled that OKC had n't paid Aminoil its full share of profits from an offshore petroleum lease that Aminoil had farmed out to OKC .
The court ordered OKC to pay Phillips the profits , plus interest , which currently total about $ 21.5 million .
OKC said it plans to file a motion for a rehearing in an attempt to overturn the decision , but the company said its chances of winning a rehearing are `` remote . ''
The company said it does n't expect the ruling to have a major impact on earnings because it had already set aside about $ 14 million in reserves to cover the judgment and reached an agreement for a bank loan to pay the balance .

The company said the new budget provides for significant additions to a number of its distribution centers , for upgrading computer equipment , for 10 new ShopKo discount department stores and for $ 70 million in financing for its independent retailer customers .

SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES SYSTEMS , or SAS , will defer for several more months a decision on whether to switch its order for 12 new airplanes to AIRBUS INDUSTRIE of Europe from MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORP. of the U.S. .
Ulf Abrahamsson , SAS 's vice president for fleet planning , said the carrier wants to study more carefully offers from the two aircraft builders .
He said SAS also wants to determine the outcome of talks that could lead to the liberalization of air travel between the U.S. and Scandinavia .

But Mr. Abrahamsson denied that SAS was trying to use the jet order to pressure the U.S. .
SAS signed a letter of intent last December to purchase 12 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets for an estimated $ 1.6 billion .
But in January it received a proposal from Airbus that it buy the European consortium 's A-340 jets .
It said then that it would make a final decision by late March .

British government bond prices advanced 1 2/32 Friday as the market continued to consolidate recent gains .
Dealers reported a little profit-taking by domestic institutions and some unwinding of positions by major market-makers who had prepared themselves for further Japanese buying overnight .
As it happened , Far Eastern interest was limited .

In new issues , Morgan Guaranty took $ 130 million of a total of $ 500 million of perpetual floating-rate notes issued by Westpac Banking Corp. , a large Australian bank , and restructured the issue into two new securities : a 15-year floating-rate note , and a 15-year zero-coupon bond .
The new 15-year floating-rate issue , priced at 100.10 , adjusts semi-annually at 50 basis points above the six-month London interbank offered rate .

Gone are the days when the U.S. could quietly enjoy looking at East Asia as its foreign-policy trophy case .
The new Japans -- Taiwan and South Korea -- were thriving economically .
China had shunned the Soviets and befriended Washington at small cost to Taiwan .
A year ago , Washington came out of the Philippines mess smelling as sweet as that country 's fresh democracy .
Now , however , foreign trade strains , political turmoil in South Korea , the Philippines ' growing pains , China 's turn back toward Communist orthodoxy and Moscow 's new diplomatic efforts in the area suddenly have created what State Department officials call `` the new East Asia challenge . ''
One problem is that economic growth in much of the region has n't been accompanied by political maturity .
The U.S. challenge is to help prevent its friends ' growing pains from becoming geopolitical nightmares .
`` We 've got to be prepared and look ahead , '' says Sen. Alan Cranston -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , chairman of the subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs .
The U.S. must stress to leaders like South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan that long-term stability can only be ensured through democracy , not by force .
It must increase its quiet diplomatic pressure on East Asian states like Taiwan and South Korea to adjust their currencies and open their markets or risk U.S. protectionism that could cause political strains .
`` We are in a transitional phase , '' says Richard Holbrooke , formerly a top State Department official and currently a managing director at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. .
`` The economies in the region have been the strongest in the world , but political stability must be maintained or their economic successes will suffer . ''
He says the U.S. should focus its efforts on areas where it can have the most impact : helping South Korea create democracy and assisting the Philippines in defending it .
South Korea is approaching what the U.S. hopes will be its first peaceful transition of power in February 1988 , just seven months before the Summer Olympics there .
Both the government and the opposition have refused to compromise on election reform .
The U.S. has thus far balked at pressing the government too hard , fearful that too quick a shift to full democracy could itself be destabilizing .
But unless it does so , President Chun is likely to create a succession scenario that leaves the leadership under the military 's influence .
American officials believe long-term stability in the Philippines can only be ensured through more economic and military aid .
`` The country needs some pump priming , '' says J. Brian Atwood , a former State Department official who is now president of the National Democratic Institute .
Mr. Holbrooke believes banks should move quickly to sort out the Philippines debt problems to open doors for more foreign investment and borrowing .
Mr. Atwood believes more weapons and funds for the military also are necessary : `` If there is going to be a single source of instability , it will be the loyalty of the military . ''
Trade tensions are a growing concern .
`` If we get into a broad-front trade war , it could slow everyone down and change the political climate dramatically , '' a State Department official says .
U.S. protectionist moves against Asian countries could slow economic growth and breed anti-Americanism in the region .
A senior official says the U.S. needs to stress that it will n't accept only a marginal appreciation in the South Korean and Taiwanese currencies against the dollar at a time when the Japanese yen has appreciated quickly .
Though Japanese products have become more expensive in the U.S. , there has n't been a corresponding narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit because , in many cases , South Korea and Taiwan products , which do n't have the same price disadvantage , have taken their place .
The Communist powers in Asia also present challenges .
Washington must lower its expectations of China as Beijing becomes more wary of Western ways .
U.S. officials believe China could assume a more neutral position between the two superpowers , particularly if Beijing 's rising star , Vice Premier Li Peng , a Soviet-trained engineer who favors strong economic central planning , takes over as premier as many expect .
Moscow has n't scored the huge diplomatic success it is seeking with Beijing , but U.S. officials worry about Mikhail Gorbachev 's proclivity for unexpected diplomatic actions .
In Mr. Gorbachev `` we are facing a creative chess master , '' says Mr. Atwood .
`` He is willing to move into new areas and take risks , be creative and keep us off balance . ''

Lac Minerals Ltd. said it will suspend underground operations at its Lake Shore mine in Kirkland Lake , Ontario , effective April 30 .
Lac said it completed mining of the present ore body .
Lake Shore , in production since 1983 , accounted for 10,600 ounces , or about 2.2 % , of Lac 's 1986 gold output of 479,264 ounces .
The company said it does n't expect the suspension to affect its earnings .

Transamerica Corp. said it agreed to sell its group insurance operations to Chattanooga , Tenn.-based Provident Life & Accident Co. .
Last month , the two companies canceled a previously reported letter of intent covering acquisition of the group operations .
They cited a disagreement over terms , but said talks would continue .
The previous terms were n't ever disclosed .
The transaction is expected to be completed by May 1 .
The insurance and financial services concern said the sale to Provident Life is structured as a reinsurance transaction , under which Provident will assume responsibility for an estimated $ 400 million of policies and other liabilities .
Transamerica said it would record a $ 75 million net gain on the sale .
But it said the gain would be largely offset by a charge to cover a change in accounting for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs being made by its Transamerica Life Cos. unit .
The company said the accounting change reflects a desire to `` state our books as conservatively as we can . ''
Separately , Transamerica said that its board authorized the buyback of as many as 2.2 million common shares , or about 3 % of its 72.7 million shares outstanding .
The planned stock buyback is in addition to a previous buyback authorization , under which the company still plans to acquire as many as 1.5 million shares .
The company said the buybacks will be used for employee benefits and stock-option plans .

Domtar Inc. said it expects its capital spending this year to total $ 838 million -LRB- Canadian -RRB- , up 76 % from $ 475.2 million spent in 1986 .
The construction materials and pulp and paper concern said in the prospectus for a proposed $ 100 million debenture offering that its recent $ 330 million purchase of Genstar Corp. 's U.S. gypsum wallboard business accounted for much of the increase .
Domtar also expects to spend $ 247 million this year on expansion of its fine-paper mill in Windsor , Quebec .
The first phase of the $ 870 million project is expected to be completed by the end of the year .
The company also plans to spend $ 36 million this year at its newsprint mill in Dolbeau , Quebec , as part of an $ 85 million project to change the plant 's pulp operations to a new process .

Engelhard Corp. said it plans to invest more than $ 50 million to build a petroleum-catalyst manufacturing facility in Venezuela .
The maker of specialty chemicals and metallurgical products said the project would be a joint venture with Quifoven-Engelhard C.A. , a Venezuelan company in which Engelhard has a 40 % stake .
Engelhard said it planned to increase its stake in the Venezuelan concern to 80 % over the next few years .
The new facility would make 20,000 metric tons a year of catalysts for use in the oil industry , the company said .
The catalysts are used to convert heavy crude oil into lighter crudes and petroleum products .
Engelhard said it plans to export 65 % of its production , mainly to Latin American countries .

Joseph Perkins 's defense of industrial homework -LRB- editorial page , March 6 -RRB- was correct on only one point : that employers use it to lower costs so they can underprice competitors .
The employer unfairly passes on his overhead for rent , machinery , repairs and electricity to the worker ; piece rates invariably yield below the minimum wage in homework settings ; benefits are unheard of , and even statutory benefits , such as Social Security , workers ' compensation and unemployment compensation , are typically evaded .
The only disadvantage for the employer , apart from the illegality , is quality control , since homework makes supervision and investment in sophisticated machinery impossible .
However , employers have a simple , if crude , method of quality control -- they do n't pay for garments that do n't meet standards or they send them back to be redone for no extra pay .
Knowing how advantageous homework is to the unscrupulous employer , Mr. Perkins should have known better than to fall for Norma Kamali 's fairy tale about the wonderful wages and conditions of her homeworkers .
The Kamali homeworkers with whom ILGWU organizers have spoken at length tell a very different story .
It was Miss Kamali who asked her workers to take work home , not vice versa .
Miss Kamali 's homeworkers were paid piece rates that yielded $ 2 an hour and less .
They received no benefits , and were ineligible for unemployment compensation when Miss Kamali had no work .
The low piece rates forced them to work long hours , and one had her children help sew .
Mr. Perkins implies that there was a positive determination that there were no violations of the minimum wage .
In fact , no investigation was completed , but one is under way .
Departments of labor often do not charge illegal homework employers because minimum-wage violations are nearly impossible to prove .
Record-keeping is nonexistent and homeworkers are frightened to speak up , knowing that they may lose the little income they have or , in the case of undocumented workers , risk exposure to the Immigration and Naturalization Service .
The inability to enforce labor standards is the reason homework was banned in 1942 and 1943 in seven apparel-related industries .
Mr. Perkins asserts that sweatshop conditions are `` very rare today . ''
In fact , a resurgence of the sweatshop began in major cities in the latter 1970s , fueled by highly competitive conditions in the import-battered garment industry and a vulnerable work force of recent immigrants .
In the 1980s , farm distress has brought similar conditions to rural America .
Mr. Perkins accuses our union of forcing manufacturers to go overseas by `` raising the cost of doing business in this country . ''
The ILGWU has fought for fair trade for many years , for precisely the same reason we fight against homework .
We do not believe that American workers should be forced to compete with inhumane standards .
Union garment workers earn modest wages -- about $ 6 an hour -- but they cannot compete with workers overseas earning 50 cents and less or with homeworkers who make $ 2 and pay their own overhead .
America cannot be strong if `` competitiveness '' is regained on the backs of workers paid poverty wages to work long hours in sweatshop conditions .
Particularly disturbing to me was Mr. Perkins 's assertion that homework violations are trivial and seldom produce charges of wage underpayment .
It is important to understand that record-keeping violations are not minor infractions ; records are essential to ensure that homeworkers receive the legal protection to which they are entitled .
While Mr. Perkins accurately stated that a 1983 court ruling allowed the Department of Labor to rewrite its homework regulations , he neglected to point out that the court questioned government 's ability to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act -LRB- FLSA -RRB- in the seven apparel industries covered by the regulatory prohibition .
The court identified four impediments to the effective enforcement of the minimum wage among homeworkers : difficulty in locating and identifying workers ; inadequate or nonexistent record-keeping ; difficulty in establishing and remedying violations , and the strain on governmental resources .
The impediments remain .
After hearings last fall , our subcommittee concluded that repealing the ban on industrial homework constitutes an abdication of the department 's FLSA responsibilities .
Miss Kamali should be aware that this country will not allow any industry to blackmail workers with the threat of job exportation .
Mr. Perkins must recognize the real threat of industrial homework -- an unprotected and exploited work force .

RENT-A-CENTER INC. said its board declared a 3-for-2 stock split , payable April 20 to shares of record April 3 .

Computer Sciences Corp. said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will award it a contract that will add about $ 25 million a year to its current computer services work for the agency .
Computer Sciences will provide engineering and analysis services to the Mission Operations and Data Systems Directorate at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. .
The new contract will consolidate the company 's work under three separate NASA contracts that currently total about $ 40 million annually .
The computer services concern said the contract , expected to take effect Nov. 15 , could last 10 years if all options are exercised , and could total $ 1 billion .
About 25 % of contract revenue would go to subcontractors , primarily the Ford Aerospace & Communications Corp. unit of Ford Motor Co. , Computer Sciences said .

In your tongue-in-cheek article on Atlanta as the site of the 1988 Democratic National Convention -LRB- page one , Feb. 13 -RRB- , you described the Carter Presidential Center , noting that it `` houses the papers of the last Democratic president . ''
It is assumed , for the sake of the efforts and aspirations of the delegates to the convention , that the author meant `` the latest Democratic president . ''
Or does he expect the Democrats to go the way of the Federalists , of which John Adams was the last to achieve the presidency ?
As an Atlanta native , recently exiled to Chicago , I could not help but wonder at your qualifications for judging barbecue .
While you ferreted out such political hot spots as Manuel 's Tavern -LRB- in the finest journalistic tradition -RRB- , it boggles the mind that you missed the famous second state capital : Harold 's Barbecue at 171 McDonough Blvd. in Southeast Atlanta .
Or Sprayberry 's Barbecue in Newman , 30 miles south of Atlanta off Highway I85 .
While , as you note , the taxi problem deserves immediate attention , Atlantans do tend to take barbecue more seriously , and we rate our native recipes over those of other , less refined , Southern states .

In the controversy on these pages over who should be enshrined in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame -LRB- arts page , Feb. 2 ; letters , Feb. 19 -RRB- , the terms `` rock 'n' roll '' and `` rock '' were often used interchangeably .
There is quite a difference .
True rock 'n' roll is the music generated and performed during the rock 'n' roll era , primarily from the mid-1950s to the very early 1960s .
On the other hand , `` rock '' is a generic term given to the music of the kids in any subsequent era : surf rock , hard rock , acid rock , heavy-metal rock and so on , with rock 'n' roll being the first generation of such music .
All inductees into the Hall of Fame should be from the rock 'n' roll era .
If performers from soul , blues , surf and other genres are to be included , the title of the institution should be the Rock Music Hall of Fame .

In your front-page article about Arthur L. Williams -LRB- Mar. 4 -RRB- , you said I have been `` ordained '' as an `` unofficial spokesman '' for the insurance industry .
I have not been `` ordained , '' and I speak only for myself .
My research , which often involves criticism of insurance practices I consider improper , is intended for the benefit of the public .
The research I have conducted on the Williams organization during the past six years has been independent , as has my research on other insurance topics .
The opinions I have expressed about the organization are mine , as are the opinions I have expressed about other insurance topics .
My research has been motivated by outrage concerning the tactics of the organization .
I believe it is against the public interest for part-time representatives to advise consumers on a financial service as important as life insurance , for life-insurance policies to be replaced indiscriminately , for an organization to make its relatively high-cost insurance appear low in cost through deception , and for competitors to be intimidated with threatening letters .

The West German government said it will proceed today with the sale of its remaining 25.55 % stake in VEBA AG , an energy , chemicals and trading group .
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank AG , one of the banks leading the placement , said the government 's 10.1 million nominal shares will be priced at the equivalent of $ 136.70 each , converting the West German mark at its current rate , bringing the issue 's total value to $ 1.38 billion .
The issue is one of Germany 's biggest .
The shares will be sold at a small discount to Veba 's market price .
Veba rose 82 cents , to $ 138.65 , on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Friday .
The announcement late Friday contradicted rumors earlier last week that the Finance Ministry would postpone the sale because of the recent drop in German share prices .
The government announced the sale of its Veba holding in January , when it expected to receive the current equivalent of between $ 147.65 and $ 169.50 for each share .
That would have valued the holding at between $ 1.49 billion and $ 1.71 billion .
But German share prices subsequently entered a prolonged slump .
The center-right government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has in recent years returned several large industrial stakes to the public sector .
In 1984 , the Bonn government lowered its stake in Veba to the current 25.55 % from 43.75 % .
The government had planned to sell a 16 % stake in Volkswagen AG later this year , but following news of an alleged foreign-exchange fraud that cost the auto maker as much as $ 259 million , Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said that the sale may be put off .
The Veba shares will be placed through a consortium of 38 German and 33 foreign banks .
About 20 % of the government stake will be sold to foreigners .

In a move that would represent a major break with tradition in the legal profession , law firms in this city may become the first in the nation to reward non-lawyers with the cherished title of partner .
The District of Columbia Bar has recommended adoption of a new code of ethics that would permit such a move , reflecting broad changes in the kind of legal services offered by the city 's firms .
The new ethics code must be approved by the D.C. Court of Appeals before it goes into effect and will apply only to lawyers and law firms that practice here .
The professional conduct of lawyers in other jurisdictions is guided by American Bar Association rules or by state bar ethics codes , none of which permit non-lawyers to be partners in law firms .
The ABA has steadfastly reserved the title of partner and partnership perks -LRB- which include getting a stake of the firm 's profit -RRB- for those with law degrees .
But Robert Jordan , a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who took the lead in drafting the new district bar code , said the ABA 's rules were viewed as `` too restrictive '' by lawyers here .
`` The practice of law in Washington is very different from what it is in Dubuque , '' he said .
Mr. Jordan said the provision allowing non-lawyers to be partners reflects shifts in providing legal services that have already occurred at many Washington law firms , which in recent years have hired high-level economists , accountants , lobbyists and other regulatory specialists .
Several firms have also launched business subsidiaries and consulting arms specializing in trade , lobbying and other areas .
Arnold & Porter , which with 300 lawyers is the largest law firm in Washington , pioneered some of these trends .
It operates a lobbying business , a bank-consulting firm and a real-estate arm which together have 60 employees , most of whom are n't lawyers .
Arnold & Porter also employs 18 non-lawyer specialists to augment different areas of its legal practice .
Some of these non-lawyer employees are paid at partners ' levels .
Yet , not having the partner title `` makes non-lawyers working in law firms second-class citizens , '' said Mr. Jordan of Steptoe & Johnson .
James Jones , the managing partner of Arnold & Porter agreed .
`` It 's tough for a non-lawyer to feel equal . ''
Mr. Jones also emphasized that non-lawyer specialists helped his law firm deliver legal services more efficiently and economically .
In 1983 , after a heated debate , the ABA rejected a proposal to let non-lawyers be partners .
Members ' chief concerns were that it could lead to a situation where businesses took control of law firms and that non-lawyers could n't be trusted to uphold the legal profession 's ethical and professional standards .
The district bar narrowed its proposal to address some of these issues .
Its proposed new code says businesses can n't acquire financial stakes in law firms , and holds attorneys responsible for the ethical behavior of their non-lawyer partners .
Still , some lawyers are dubious .
`` Non-lawyers are not trained in the same way , '' said Jamie Gorelick , a partner at a Washington law firm and member of the bar committee that drafted the new code .
The local appeals court will vote on the code after a comment period ending Dec. 1 .
Only a handful of comments have been received so far , mostly concerning other provisions of the code , according to the clerk 's office .
While he awaits the court 's decision , Mr. Jordan compared those who do n't want to let non-lawyers be partners to the Dr. Seuss characters called Star Bellied Sneetches , who taunt those who do n't have stars on their bellies .
`` They think you can n't be a partner because you do n't have that law degree on the wall , '' he said .

The nation 's factories , mines and utilities operated at their highest rate in more than eight years in October , using 84 % of their capacity , the Federal Reserve Board reported .
In a second report , the Commerce Department said business inventories grew 0.7 % in September , reaching a seasonally adjusted $ 749.38 billion .
In August , inventories increased a revised 1.1 % .
October 's operating rate , which followed a revised 83.8 % rate in September , matched the rate of February 1980 and was slightly below the January 1980 rate of 84.1 % .
The utilization rate for manufacturing alone in October was 84.3 % after running at a revised 84.1 % the month before .
Utilities and mines were less pressed ; the rate for utilities edged up to 80.8 % from 80.6 % in September while that for mines dropped to 81.8 % from 82.4 % .
When capacity-utilization rates creep too close to full capacity , economists worry that efficiency will decline and production bottlenecks will occur , leading to shortages and ultimately to higher prices .
But Jerry Jasinowski , chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers , said that while the latest figures suggest that danger , the threat is n't yet severe .
`` I think October 's capacity numbers reflect a bounce-back in orders , industrial production and economic activity that is going to continue over the next several months , '' he said .
`` I think the tightening of the capacity numbers does suggest some additional wage and inflation pressure , but I think manufacturers have developed a cost-control mindset that is going to hold the lid on prices and costs . ''
The increase in factory operating rates came mostly in durable-goods industries , particularly motor vehicles and parts .
While the rise in the nation 's business inventories was solid in September , sales were little changed from the month before , totaling $ 495.45 billion compared with $ 495.48 billion in August .
September inventories represented 1.51 months ' sales , up from 1.50 in August .
Although business inventories rose across the board , manufacturers and retailers reported far larger increases than wholesalers .
Stocks of manufacturers were up 0.6 % and their inventory-sales ratio reached 1.57 months .
Retailers ' inventories grew 1.5 % from August , pushing their inventory-sales ratio to 1.65 .
Wholesale stocks inched up 0.1 % with the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.28 .
Increasing inventories sometimes foreshadow economic downturns because they can lead to cuts in production .
But economists said yesterday 's figures indicate businesses are keeping inventories largely in line with sales .

Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. have discovered a new family of superconductors that may help scientists ' understanding of the important electrical phenomenon .
The AT&T compounds , concocted from lead , strontium , copper oxide and other materials , do n't break any performance records for superconductors and may never find any practical applications .
But their unexpected properties upset some prior scientific assumptions about superconductivity and may speed the current , world-wide search for better , commercially useful superconducting materials .
`` It 's helping us build up an overall picture of what superconductivity 's about , '' said one prominent British scientist familiar with the AT&T work .
AT&T 's unearthing of the new superconductor family confirms most physicists ' view that `` there may well be many more -LRB- superconductors -RRB- to be discovered '' -- some of them better-performing -- said Colin Gough , head of the superconductivity-research group at the University of Birmingham , England .
A report of the AT&T discovery is to be published today in Nature , a leading British scientific journal that often prints superconductor studies .
First news of the work was discussed last week by scientists at a materials-research conference in Strasbourg , France .
Sixteen AT&T scientists at the New York-based company 's Murray Hill , N.J. , Bell Laboratories co-authored the Nature report .
They were led by AT&T scientists Robert J. Cava and Bertram Batlogg , two pioneers of superconductor research .
The once-quiet study of superconductivity became one of the hottest fields in physics after a 1986 discovery by scientists at International Business Machines Corp. Normally , all materials put up some energy-wasting resistance to an electric current passing through them .
But a superconducting material , when chilled , loses all resistance .
The IBM researchers found a superconducting material that needed comparatively little chilling -- raising the possibility of cheaper , faster computers , electric-power stations and other electrical devices made from the materials .
Since 1986 , four main families of `` high-temperature '' superconductors have been identified .
The fifth , AT&T 's discovery , is a distant cousin of the earlier varieties -- based , like most of them , on copper oxide laced with other elements .
AT&T 's family adds lead and strontium as basic structural elements ; any of several other elements , added in minute quantities , distinguishes one member of the AT&T family from another .
In a telephone interview , Robert Laudise , Bell Laboratories ' director of materials chemistry research , said the lead-strontium compounds are unusual in having more copper and less oxygen in their makeup than many scientists previously thought possible for a superconductor .
It suggests , he said , that scientists searching for better superconductors may have overlooked some low-oxygen materials on the incorrect assumption that they would n't work .
The research , he said , `` is just one more clue that fits into the puzzle '' of which materials can -- and can n't -- work as superconductors .
Mr. Laudise said , however , that the new lead-strontium materials themselves may have little immediate practical value .
They must go through more-costly chilling than many other superconductors , to at least 68 degrees centigrade above absolute zero . -LRB- Theoretically equal to minus 273.15 degrees centigrade , absolute zero is the hypothetical temperature characterized by the complete absence of heat . -RRB-
Some other , more-promising superconductors need chilling only to 125 degrees above absolute zero .

The Treasury plans to raise $ 5.35 billion in new cash with the sale next week of about $ 9 billion in two-year notes and about $ 7.5 billion in five-year , two-month notes .
The balance of the proceeds will be used to redeem $ 11.14 billion in maturing two-year notes .
The new two-year notes , to be sold Tuesday , will mature Nov. 30 , 1990 .
The five-year , two-month notes , to be sold Wednesday , will mature Feb. 15 , 1994 .
Tenders for the notes must be received by 1 p.m. EST on the date of the respective auctions at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
The shorter notes are available in minimum denominations of $ 5,000 and the longer notes will be sold in minimum lots of $ 1,000 .

Nerco Inc. said a unit agreed in principle to acquire certain oil and natural-gas properties from Enron Inc. , Houston , for about $ 90 million .
The transaction , which is subject to signing of a final agreement , would bring Nerco 's total 1988 purchases of Gulf Coast reserves to about $ 270 million .
The company 's Nerco Oil & Gas Inc. unit said its strategy of acquiring oil and gas reserves during periods of relatively low energy prices `` is beginning to show positive strategic and financial benefits . ''
An official said Nerco Oil & Gas , which had operating losses totaling $ 54.2 million in the past three years , has returned to profitability this year and is comfortable with analysts ' projections the unit will show about $ 10 million in operating profit for all of 1988 .
Rising natural-gas prices and increased production are fueling the rebound , he said .
Nerco , which also has interests in coal and precious-metals mining , is 90 % -owned by PacifiCorp , a diversified utility holding company based in Portland .
Enron said the accord is part of a previously announced plan to sell $ 200 million to $ 300 million of non-strategic oil and gas properties .
With the completion of this latest pact , the company will have sold about $ 250 million of those properties .
Proceeds will be used to help reduce Enron 's debt , which stands at $ 3.87 billion .

George Melloan 's Business World article `` Could Another Market Crash Happen ?
Sure '' -LRB- op-ed , Oct. 18 -RRB- regarding my position on the dollar and on stock-market reform contained a number of inaccuracies .
First , I have never demanded that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady appear before the Senate Banking Committee to explain the dollar 's rise as Mr. Melloan claims in his article .
What I did was send a letter to Mr. Brady asking him to address the implications of the dollar 's recent rise on our current account deficit .
I also asked him to present his views on the outlook for the current account deficit in the future .
I made these requests because the Treasury was preparing to submit to the Banking Committee the first report on international economic policy as required by Section 3005 of the Omnibus Trade Competitiveness Act of 1988 and because I felt that those issues were important .
Mr. Melloan suggests that this was a parting shot at Wall Street .
Does he suggest that requesting the treasury secretary to present and clarify the administration 's view of the outlook for our current account deficit and the growth of our nation 's net foreign indebtedness is contrary to the interests of the financial sector ?
That is ironic in light of the widely held view among economists , businessmen and other devotees of a free-market system such as myself that clear , credible , high-quality information will resolve unnecessary uncertainty and permit investors to make their investment decisions with greater confidence .
While it had nothing to do with my sending a letter to Secretary Brady , it would also be foolishly simplistic to suggest that a change in the value of the dollar is contrary to the interests of the financial sector .
First of all , changes in the exchange rate are often associated with a heightened volume of trading that increases the earnings of Wall Street traders .
Second , as was in evidence between 1985 and 1987 , a change in the value of the dollar affects the medium-term outlook for earnings and can generate substantial activity in the equity market .
Many commentators have attributed the rise in the stock market in 1987 to the improvements in our export -- and import -- competing sectors .
Surely that was not contrary to the interests of substantial parts of Wall Street .
Such a simplistic specification , casting me against Wall Street and private enterprise , is both inaccurate and belittles the sophistication of the readers of The Wall Street Journal .
Second , Mr. Melloan states that the `` markets know quite clearly what Sen. Proxmire has in mind when he calls on Secretary Brady to explain himself .
He wants a soft currency . ''
That is clearly false .
If Mr. Melloan would only look at my record he would find that when the Banking Committee held hearings in February and July in regard to the Humphrey Hawkins Monetary Policy Report I stated in the record that I feared that a further decline in the dollar would exacerbate economic stagnation in other industrial countries and slow economic growth world-wide .
I did not then , and do not now , want a soft currency .
What I do want is to establish a clear , coherent and sustainable policy to reduce our current account deficit over a reasonable time horizon that is consistent with the problems of adjustment that will be experienced by the surplus and the deficit countries and is also consistent with price stability .
I also believe that the level and future path of the exchange rate are intimately intertwined with the future course of our trade deficit and are therefore the proper subject of concern and debate .
Finally , with regard to stock market system reform , Mr. Melloan cavalierly asserts that I made the comment that it `` would be better to do the wrong thing than nothing at all . ''
I said no such thing .
Furthermore , many executives in the securities industry strongly supported my efforts to facilitate the modernization of our stock-market system along the lines that Mr. Brady 's report suggested .
Our stock-market system has changed substantially following the innovations in stock-related derivative instruments and our regulatory system has not yet responded to those changes .
I still believe , as do many professionals in the securities industry , that modernization of our regulatory structure is a high priority for the next administration and the 101st Congress .

Standard & Poor 's Corp. said it is putting $ 17 billion of New York state debt on CreditWatch with negative implications .
New York faces a $ 1.94 billion budget gap for the current fiscal year , which ends March 31 , mostly because of a shortage in personal income tax collections .
The legislature has plugged roughly half the gap , but it needs to find an additional $ 944 million .
In addition , the state faces an anticipated shortage the following fiscal year .
`` We 're waiting to see whether the legislature comes up with a program that addresses the problem in a fiscally responsible manner , '' says Maury Cooper , a vice president at S&P .
`` If they do n't we 'll downgrade them . ''
Affected are $ 3.8 billion of double-A-minus general obligation bonds ; $ 2.6 billion of SP-1-plus tax and revenue anticipation notes ; $ 500 million of authorized A-1-plus commercial paper , and $ 10.1 billion of variously rated moral obligation , lease purchase , guaranteed and contractual obligation debt .
Last week , the state released a midyear update to its financial plan identifying possible deficit-reduction measures .
`` With minor exceptions , these alternatives do n't address the shortfall in a manner that assures ongoing fiscal balance , '' S&P warned .
Some of the proposed actions , it said , `` only defer the problem to subsequent fiscal years and are inconsistent with the state 's current credit ratings . ''
New York 's comptroller , Edward V. Regan , seconded S&P 's warning .
He said measures such as delaying income tax refunds , which the state is considering , `` will cause the state to slip back to the old ways of fiscal manipulation . ''
He said `` genuine and permanent spending restraint is absolutely required . ''

Cray Research Inc. said it named Marcelo A. Gumucio president and chief operating officer .
As president , Mr. Gumucio , 50 years old , fills a post that has been vacant for at least the past six years , the supercomputer maker said .
It was last held by John A. Rollwagen , Cray 's 47-year-old chairman and chief executive officer .
The post of chief operating officer is new .
Mr. Rollwagen said Mr. Gumucio , who has been executive vice president , marketing since 1983 , will focus on the day-to-day activities and the `` accomplishment of objectives spanning one to three years . ''
Mr. Rollwagen said he will devote his attention to long-term strategies and objectives .
Cray also named Robert H. Ewald , formerly vice president , software division , to executive vice president , software ; and Edward A. Masi , formerly vice president , marketing , to senior vice president , marketing .
Mr. Masi will assume Mr. Gumucio 's management duties .
The company also said it formed a Technical Council responsible for setting `` long-term product development direction . ''
Cray said Mr. Rollwagen will chair the council and that other members will include founder Seymour Cray ; Lester T. Davis , executive vice president ; and Mr. Ewald .

Kuhlman Corp. `` fully expects to be profitable '' in the fourth quarter of 1988 after six consecutive quarters of losses , Donald O. Dulude , chairman and chief executive officer , said .
Kuhlman , which makes power transformers and plastic products , reported a net loss of $ 1.8 million on sales of $ 46.8 million in the year-ago fourth quarter .
In the first nine months of this year , the company posted a net loss of $ 9.3 million on sales of $ 131.8 million .
However , most of the loss in the first three quarters of 1988 came from a net charge of $ 9.1 million , taken in the third quarter , to reflect the discontinuation of Kuhlman 's unprofitable Borse Plastic Products Corp. unit .
The charge was the last of $ 13.3 million in restructuring costs for Kuhlman in 1988 .
In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , the company closed unchanged yesterday at $ 8.375 a share .
`` We 've got the worst behind us , '' Mr. Dulude said .
`` This restructuring was a drain , not only from a financial standpoint , but also in terms of human resources because everybody was working to stem the losses .
Now we can direct our attention to moving forward . ''
Mr. Dulude said the company expects to see gains from the early October transfer of some non-metallic automotive fuel tank production to its Canadian operations from U.S. plants .
Productivity at the company 's Blenheim , Ont. , plant had been lower than expected this year because of weak demand for Chrysler Corp. 's Eagle Premier sedan , which is built in Canada and uses Kuhlman plastic fuel tanks made there .
As a result , Kuhlman 's Canadian plastics operations had been posting losses .
The company said the shift of production will make its Bronson , Mich. , plant less profitable .
But Mr. Dulude said a reconfiguration of the Bronson plant will offset some of the impact .
Mr. Dulude said a joint venture with Togo Seisakusyo of Japan should help Kuhlman 's spring operations to generate more business with the U.S. manufacturing assembly arms of Asian auto makers and parts suppliers .
Mr. Dulude also said the company has been raising prices for Kuhlman 's power transformers to catch up with higher raw materials costs seen earlier this year .

Mr. Baird 's reference to preserving the `` freedom of association '' of nonunion workers ignores the fact that since 1935 the law of the land has tried to protect those who want to be represented by a labor organization of their choice .
The law 's protections have never been strong enough to overcome the persuasive power of some employers who `` exercise their right of freedom of speech '' to subtly threaten the livelihoods of those who engage in union activity .
A 1984 House report cited `` the sharp rise over the past twenty years in illegal employer tactics to counter unionization efforts . ''
Recent decisions made by pro-management appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the federal courts have further encouraged the union-busters by reducing what little protection the law formerly gave to otherwise defenseless employees .
Since unionized employees command substantially higher wages and benefits than most of their unrepresented counterparts , it is obvious that most working men and women would choose to join unions were it not for the heavy-handed tactics of some employers and their friends in positions of authority .

Just seven months after introducing a sweeping securities rulebook , Britain plans to overhaul its regulations , replacing a tough regime of business-conduct rules with a looser , simplified code of good-practice principles .
The watchdog Securities and Investments Board said its new draft rules assure the same standards of investor protection as the more detailed regulations they replace .
Separately , the government said it will repeal a law giving any U.K. investor the right to sue securities firms for breaking financial laws .
Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said the law as it now stands `` could lead to an excessively litigious approach in the financial markets . ''
It will be restricted to permit only private investors the statutory right to sue .
Britain 's new rules still require financial services firms to be pure .
But the new rulebook -- about two-thirds the length of the old one -- reduces the obligations on firms to demonstrate their purity and their possible legal liability when they are n't .
SIB Chairman David Walker said , `` Less reliance on detailed rules will actually be more effective in protecting investors '' because British authorities can crack down on breaches of the code 's spirit instead of its written rules .
The biggest change in the new code , effective next July , absolves investment firms from strict liability for breaching rules by providing them with the defense they were acting reasonably , or to their best abilities .
The rules also reduce the level of detail required of firms in so-called know-your-client rules .
And the code effectively widens the notion of a professional or experienced investor , who gets less protection than small investors .
Mr. Walker conceded the new code is `` at a higher level of generality , '' and will increase the discretionary power of the regulators -- most of whom are industry professionals themselves .
Such changes reduce the regulatory system 's predictability and transparency , originally intended to be its virtues .
Though the new rules increase the possibility regulators ' decisions may favor firms over clients , Mr. Walker said he considers that risk `` insignificant when compared to the gain in user-friendliness . ''
He added , `` I do n't think we are taking teeth out , but are putting teeth in more effective parts of the jaw . ''
The rewrite is a substantial turnabout .
Less than two years ago , a series of financial scandals prompted the election-minded Conservative government to tighten Britain 's securities regulatory regime .
But the rules , effective last April , were sharply criticized as overly complex and costly by the financial services industry .
Economists estimated compliance costs at $ 180 million .
Since then , the government has become increasingly concerned by industry threats that the system -- the toughest in Europe -- might drive business out of London as the 1992 deadline for removing remaining European Community trade barriers nears .
Mr. Walker echoed those worries yesterday .
`` We can have highly defined regulation that leaves nothing but desert out there , '' he said , referring to London 's bustling financial district .
Meantime , securities industry professionals are rejoicing .
The Securities Association , leading industry regulator for London 's stock and bond markets , welcomed the rewrite and said it is rewriting its own weighty rulebook .
Other self-regulatory bodies are expected to follow suit .
The new rules , said the chief securities law expert at one of the biggest U.S. investment banks in London , `` simplify things .
There can be simplification and still be rules . ''

You are to be commended for your Nov. 1 article `` Men , Too , Wrestle With Career-Family Stress . ''
Within the past year , several other publications have reported on the difficulties of effectively managing employment and parental responsibilities but focused on the issue as though it confronted only women .
As your article pointed out , men are similarly faced with competing compelling pressures .
The view of Cynthia Grantz , president of Rockford Coatings Corp. , that `` child rearing is largely the mother 's domain , '' surely ignores present-day reality .
Undoubtedly , employer attitudes based on such sexual stereotypes will lead to diminished job satisfaction for parents and , in the long run , the employer 's detriment .

Soured on silver , bored with gold ?
These days , big governments are peddling platinum coins .
Australia recently became the first major nation to offer a platinum bullion coin , the Koala .
Today , the Canadian Royal Mint will unveil its Platinum Maple Leaf .
And Mexico soon plans to launch a Platinum Libertad .
The new issues come amid heightened competition among leading bullion nations for coin investors .
Dealers say the recent push partly reflects an effort by the platinum industry to polish the metal 's image .
`` Platinum has always been gold 's stepchild , '' says Luis Vigdor , senior vice president of MTB Banking Corp. , a large New York dealer .
The recent coin parade , he says , is a `` commercial effort to place platinum at the same level . ''
But do n't expect the coins to glitter like gold .
Platinum -- considered by some the ugly duckling among precious metals even though it costs more -- resembles gun metal , or a dulled silver .
Like other bullion coins , the new platinum issues will cost about 5 % to 7 % above the metal 's spot-market price , which yesterday closed at $ 580.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Still , platinum is a better buy than other precious metals , some numismatists say .
Two major factors : its extreme rarity and broad industrial uses .
`` In the parlance of the dealer , platinum has the sexiest story to tell , '' says Bruce Kaplan , senior vice president of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc. , a large Santa Monica , Calif. , wholesaler .
A report issued this week by Johnson Matthey PLC shows why .
The big London-based refiner forecasts record platinum demand this year .
Stemming partly from the new coin issues , demand will outstrip supply by 465,000 ounces in 1988 , more than double last year 's amount , the report says .
If there 's a loser in all the activity , it will be the tiny Isle of Man .
Dealers say that country 's Noble coin , until recently the only legal-tender platinum piece on the market , is sure to lose sales .
Next on the platinum horizon : the Soviet Union .
Look for the Russians to offer a platinum coin in the U.S. before year end .
But unlike the other new issues , it will cater to collectors and will n't be legal tender .

Re your Oct. 27 article `` Failure to Wear Seat Belts Can Cut Crash-Suit Awards '' : It provided a good overview of the issue of mandatory seat-belt use .
As a concerned citizen , I for one support the mandatory-use laws and I 'm in favor of reduced awards in the case of a victim 's injuries being exacerbated through failure to wear a seat belt .
But the article failed to point out that another reason defense lawyers are fighting this trend is that their contingency fees are at risk .
The real issue is the liability-insurance crisis that this country has experienced and its effect on all of society .
The entire basis of insurance is shared risk .
All of us share the cost when negligence increases that risk .
To paraphrase an old adage , `` Your right to not wear a seat belt ends at the tip of my insurance bill . ''

Kyocera Corp. said unconsolidated , or parent-company , pretax earnings in the first half ended Sept. 30 grew 20 % , to 24.73 billion yen -LRB- $ 201.2 million -RRB- from 20.62 billion yen a year earlier .
Kyocera , Japan 's leading maker of ceramic packages for integrated circuits , said net income rose 17 % , to 11.82 billion yen from 10.10 billion yen .
Sales increased 16 % , to 151.43 billion yen -LRB- $ 1.23 billion -RRB- from 131.02 billion yen .
Company officials said sales and earnings were boosted by strong demand for semiconductors and other electronic devices in Japan and abroad .
Exports increased 12 % and were 47 % of overall sales .
For the full fiscal year , the company expects pretax profit to increase to 51.33 billion yen from 42.60 billion yen the previous year .
Net income is expected to rise to 24.22 billion yen from 19.88 billion yen , while sales are forecast to increase to 310.43 billion yen from 271.17 billion yen .

Cie. Financiere de Suez said first-half consolidated , or group , profit fell 19 % from a year earlier , but predicted full-year earnings will increase 3 % to 17 % .
The French financial holding company said profit after payments to minority interests dipped to 1.17 billion francs -LRB- $ 197 million -RRB- from 1.44 billion francs in 1987 's first half .
Suez linked the erosion to a decrease in revenue from the sale of securities and to an increase in new provisions for loan losses to 1.44 billion francs from 940 million francs a year earlier .
Profit growth was also limited by the fact the majority stake Suez bought this year in Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. has n't been incorporated into its results .
These negative elements were partly offset by strong first-half performances by Suez 's main operating units .
Despite the first-half slowdown , Suez predicted profit for all of 1988 will be between 2.2 billion francs and 2.5 billion francs , up from 2.13 billion francs in all of 1987 .

For months , Japan and Indonesia have been feuding over Jakarta 's attempt to get a bigger share of the aluminum produced at a jointly owned smelter in Sumatra .
Now , it turns out that the Indonesian official who triggered the dispute has a personal interest in such a reallocation .
Abdul Rauf Suhud , chairman of the Asahan Authority , which oversees the $ 2.1 billion smelter , justified his demand -- which he backed up by cutting off aluminum exports to Japan -- on national-interest grounds .
He told a news conference last month that Indonesia deserved a bigger quota than the 41 % that coincides with its equity stake because of its `` very generous '' contributions to the project , such as tax incentives and water for power generation .
Financially , Mr. Suhud complained , the Indonesian government `` virtually does n't get anything '' from the smelter .
The aluminum-export ban has angered the Japanese partners , who call it a breach of contract .
The stoppage , say businessmen and officials from both countries , has harmed Jakarta 's ties with Tokyo , Indonesia 's largest source of loans and investment .
The cutoff was imposed in July , although two subsequent shipments to Japan have been allowed .
What Mr. Suhud did n't mention at the October press conference was his involvement in a private venture that seeks eventually to process nearly one-third of the smelter 's production .
Called P.T. Asahan Aluminum Alloys , or P.T. AAA , it consists of a new Indonesian company , a new Guernsey , Channel Islands , company , and an existing Indonesian trading company .
According to documents filed with Indonesia 's Capital Investment Coordinating Board , Mr. Suhud represents both the new companies in dealings with Indonesian agencies .
There is no evidence that Mr. Suhud , a former industry minister and former deputy chairman of the investment board , is a shareholder in P.T. AAA .
But the documents establish that he and an Indonesian banker working in Singapore were central to setting it up , with assistance from other Asahan Authority officials .
Given current Indonesian domestic use of Asahan aluminum and contract commitments to the Japanese partners , P.T. AAA would n't have access to sufficient aluminum unless Japan is forced to accept a cut in its quota .
P.T. AAA 's $ 28 million plant , to be built within three years near the smelter , is to make aluminum metal for construction materials .
Approval for the plant was given by the investment board on Aug. 24 -- the day after Mr. Suhud publicly confirmed that he had suspended monthly shipments from the smelter because of the dispute with the Japanese partners .
Although Mr. Suhud 's connection with the venture has changed the complexion of the Japan-Indonesia quarrel , his connections with the private companies have received scant public attention in Indonesia .
Japanese officials working on the Asahan dispute are reluctant to discuss the matter for fear of aggravating it .
The Asahan chairman has asserted he has full support from the government for his tough line on the Japanese .
`` I could n't do this sort of thing -LCB- suspending exports -RCB- if it was n't acceptable to the government , '' he told the news conference .
Officials at the Finance Ministry , Indonesia 's official shareholder in the smelter , say they are working to resolve the dispute quickly but decline to comment further .
But some government officials privately say they are upset that Mr. Suhud is involved in a private downstream project while at the same time he is a government official overseeing the smelter .
Mr. Suhud declined repeated requests by this newspaper to comment on his role with the venture .
P. Samadiono Samadikun , secretary of the Asahan Authority , says the chairman wants to comply with government instructions not to comment at present `` on any subject whatsoever '' connected with aluminum .
The Japanese partners in the smelter also decline to comment on any aspect of the dispute .
Half of Japan 's 59 % stake is jointly held by 12 companies handling aluminum ; the other half belongs to the Japanese government .
Until they learned of Mr. Suhud 's connection with the private processing venture , the Japanese were baffled by his actions , especially the export ban that is costing Indonesia export earnings at a time of high world aluminum prices .
The smelter is supposed to give Indonesia 75,000 metric tons a year , or a third of production , whichever is less .
Mr. Suhud argues this formula covers only the aluminum project 's obligation to the Indonesian government , and he claims the rest of output should be divided in accordance with shareholdings .
That means Indonesia would get 60 % of output -- an increase Japan has vehemently resisted .
For the investors in P.T. AAA , there may not be a hurry to get the venture moving ; it does n't plan to begin commercial production until late 1990 .
But there is a need for Indonesia and Japan to resolve their argument quickly .
Besides causing a big stock buildup at the smelter , harming bilateral ties and cutting Jakarta 's export earnings , the aluminum-export ban is damaging Indonesia 's investment climate , businessmen from both countries say .
They add that relations between Mr. Suhud and the Japanese are so sour that it will be almost impossible for the two sides to work together again .

Cable & Wireless PLC said it posted a 20 % rise in pretax profit in its fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 , with its Mercury Communications Telephone System in Britain reporting a profit for the first time .
Group profit before tax for the British telecommunications company rose to # 198 million -LRB- $ 358.7 million -RRB- from # 165 million , while revenue increased 9 % to # 509 million from # 467 million .
After tax and minority interest payments , profit rose 24 % to # 135 million from # 109 million .
Net income rose 28 % , to # 139 million from # 109 million .
The Mercury subsidiary , the only licensed competitor to British Telecommunications PLC in the United Kingdom telephone market , contributed # 4 million to group operating profit .
This compared with an # 11 million loss a year earlier .
The results were at the bottom end of a range of analysts ' forecasts , dealers said .

The barrage of statistics unleashed by Warren T. Brookes -LRB- `` Surprise !
Home Buyers Are Better Off Now , '' editorial page , Oct. 17 -RRB- fails to address the dilemma of young families who perceive the American Dream of home-ownership becoming an impossible one as they are increasingly squeezed in today 's financial environment .
According to the National Association of Realtors , home `` affordability '' declined sharply from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s .
Sizable down payments , as much as 25 % of the purchase price , combined with other closing costs , many mandated by state regulations , present an all-too-often insurmountable obstacle to first-time buyers .
Changes in the tax laws in 1986 further undercut the benefits of home-ownership .
Today , people commute unprecedented distances to their workplaces in order to own a home they can afford .
In short , the hunger for ownership has replaced location as the major buyer concern .
And while buyers sacrifice location to achieve ownership , current trends make the dream more distant than ever .
Throughout our history , despite the Great Depression and the economic and social disruptions of two World Wars , Americans took home-ownership for granted .
They no longer can .
During the 1980s , for the first time since the Depression , there has been a sustained decline in home-ownership .
The largest decreases were experienced by those under 25 years old and those in the prime home-buying ages of 25 to 34 .
Yet too little attention has been given to previously proposed legislation that provides several enlightened remedial measures to narrow the `` affordability gap . ''
These include changes in the tax code that would allow first-time home buyers to use funds withdrawn -LRB- without penalty -RRB- from IRA or Keogh accounts for down payment on a principal residence .
With home-ownership and derivative industries accounting for 10 % of the gross national product , and considering the increase in local tax bases accruing from home-ownership , can we afford not to support these proposals ?
It is clearly in the interests of our elected officials at all government levels -- city , county , state and national -- to implement effective programs designed to increase opportunities for home-ownership .
More important , it is in the best interests of our citizenry .
A growing number of Americans question the capacity of Social Security to provide sufficient income after retirement and the investment in home-ownership provides the only proven means to lifetime security .
This is one of the most important issues facing the country today , and it must become a priority of the next administration .
At stake is nothing less that the foundation of the American way of life as it will be defined in the coming century .

Sony Corp. said its net income more than doubled in the second quarter ended Sept. 30 , as sales soared 46 % .
The Japanese electronics giant said consolidated , or group , profit rose to 13.08 billion yen -LRB- $ 106.1 million -RRB- from 4.76 billion yen a year earlier , as sales grew to a record 528.69 billion yen -LRB- $ 4.29 billion -RRB- from 361.36 billion yen .
For the fiscal first half , net income more than tripled , to 29.18 billion yen from 8.01 billion yen .
Sales rose 42 % , to 992.26 billion yen from 699.15 billion yen .
Sony said sales increased both domestically and abroad , and in all product groups .
It added that it continues to restructure its operations and reduce costs in an effort to counter the effects of the yen 's appreciation .
That includes shifting production overseas .
In the second quarter , overseas production accounted for 30 % of foreign sales , which in turn made up 67 % of total sales .
For the full fiscal year , Sony expects net income to exceed 60 billion yen and sales to rise above two trillion yen .

Britain 's Department of Trade and Industry cleared British Gas PLC 's $ 194.5 million acquisition of Tenneco Inc. 's oil and gas exploration and production interests outside North America , saying it would n't request an investigation of the transaction for its impact on competition .

Vulcan Corp. moved to distribute most of the 520,180 shares of Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. it holds by declaring a special dividend to stockholders .
The dividend will be in lieu of the company 's quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share due in December .
The maker of rubber and plastic products said it plans next month at a yet-undetermined date to distribute one share of Eagle-Picher stock for each three shares of Vulcan common held by stockholders of record Nov. 28 .
The special dividend has a current value of about $ 5.33 a Vulcan share .
Vulcan said its action will permit shareholders to make their own determination whether to sell such shares or hold them for a long-term investment .
Separately , directors voted to ask shareholders at a Dec. 13 special meeting to change the company 's state of incorporation to Delaware from Ohio because Vulcan no longer does any manufacturing in Ohio .
Its factories are in Tennessee , Arkansas and Wisconsin , with about 78 % of its sales generated from products made in Tennessee .

Allied Irish Banks PLC said pretax profit rose 37 % in the first half ended Sept. 30 , boosted by higher lending volumes , healthy growth in non-interest income and a reduction in bad-debt charges .
The Dublin-based bank said pretax profit rose to 79 million Irish punt -LRB- $ 120.8 million -RRB- in the first half from 57.6 million punt a year ago .
The year-ago figure excludes 9.5 million punt in loan-loss provisions .
The results compared with Allied Irish 's forecast in September that pretax profit would be `` at least '' 70 million punt .
Banking analysts said the results were slightly above expectations .
Profit after tax and minorities rose 46 % to 52 million punt from 35.7 million punt .
An Allied Irish official said negotiations are continuing with First Maryland Bancorp over Allied Irish 's offer to buy the 50.3 % of First Maryland it does n't already own for $ 35.25 a share .
Last month , a special committee of First Maryland 's board recommended that its shareholders reject the Allied Irish offer as inadequate .

Windmere Corp. said the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington has ruled in favor of the company in antitrust litigation involving N.V. Philips 's Norelco shavers .
David M. Friedson , Windmere 's president , said the court 's decision , which reverses a lower court finding for the Dutch-based electronics giant , strengthens Windmere 's assertion that Philips is a `` monopolist . ''
A spokesman for N.A. Philips Corp. , a unit named in the suit along with U.S. Philips Corp. , said that Philips , as a matter of policy , does n't comment on matters under litigation .
Windmere , a maker of personal care products , maintains that in 1986 Philips drove it out of the three-head rotary shaver market by offering 35 % to 40 % discounts on old models of its Norelco shaver , underselling Windmere by 25 % to 30 % .
As a result , Windmere said , it suffered damages in the range of $ 13 million to $ 39 million and abandoned the market less than two years later .
Windmere said it seeks to recover triple damages of between $ 39 million and $ 117 million in 1986 dollars , an amount it estimates to be between $ 50 million to $ 150 million in 1988 dollars .
Windmere said it is unlikely the Supreme Court will choose to hear the case .
It is probable , the company said , that the suit will be remanded for retrial or settled out of court .
`` We believe we will recover damages plus about $ 3 million in legal fees , '' said Mr. Friedson .

Investor Hugh Culverhouse said he terminated his $ 20-a-share , or $ 71.9 million , bid to acquire Coast Federal Savings & Loan Association .
Mr. Culverhouse 's company , Palmer Financial Corp. , said a Federal Home Loan Bank Board resolution last week `` rewrote key provisions '' of the original acquisition agreement and required conditions on the acquisition that Palmer Financial and Mr. Culverhouse could n't accept .
Coast Federal President Robert W. Antrim said the Sarasota , Fla. , thrift 's board will meet today with its lawyers and advisers `` to see what our next step is .
`` I do n't know what the end result will be , '' he said .
In July , Coast Federal said it would take legal action when Mr. Culverhouse said he might terminate the agreement because of concern over the thrift 's financial situation .
Among the reasons for calling off the bid , Palmer Financial said , was the Bank Board 's insistence that Palmer Financial bear the $ 1.5 million cost of terminating the existing employee stock-option plan .
Another condition which helped doom the bid , Palmer Financial said , was the Bank Board 's insistence that Mr. Culverhouse inject additional capital into the thrift if the reappraisal of the Palmer Ranch -- a 10,000-acre property being jointly developed by Mr. Culverhouse and the thrift -- required Coast Federal to reduce its capital below certain levels .
The Bank Board also required Mr. Culverhouse to provide Palmer Financial with any additional capital it may have needed to pay a $ 72.5 million loan commitment to Miami-based Southeast Banking Corp. 's Southeast Bank unit .
In national over the counter trading Coast Federal closed at $ 12.625 a share , down $ 3.375 .

The long campaign to win the presidency is over at last , with a clear winner in the White House and equally clear winners in Congress .
A long campaign to confront reality must now begin , and the odds against a clear winner are very long .
But this is the campaign that really counts , because at issue is not victory at the polls , but governance ; not media manipulation , but national regeneration .
There is little need to emphasize the overwhelming requirement to confront the country 's multiple deficit and debt problems .
Foreign debt , national debt , personal debt and corporate debt : Combined , they have created a mountain of unprecedented size .
The markets and our allies are equally terrified that George Bush and Congress will be unable to get past the lip-reading stage and cut a political deal .
For a number of reasons , including my certainty that no one in Washington wants to participate in the murder of economic stability , I think such a deal will be cut .
But that mountain having been climbed , the real Alps lie ahead .
Mr. Bush has said he wants to be an education president , which is a good thing for the country .
Our educational system , once the basis of national strength and the cornerstone of our civic enterprise , is in rotten condition .
It produces very well for those who are already blessed at birth .
It produces very poorly for those whose parents are not white , middle class and/or native-born .
Former Labor Secretary William Brock used to make two points about this creeping crisis .
First , he noted , by the year 2000 , about 80 % of the new entrants in the labor force will be made up of immigrants , minorities and women .
As he said , `` They are people who have traditionally been disadvantaged. . . .
And in too many cases , uneducated or improperly educated . ''
To quote him again , if we do not reverse course as we plunge headlong into the new information age , the U.S. will create `` something we fought a revolutionary war to get away from , and a civil war , and that is a class society . ''
Within 22 years , give or take a few , a majority of all the kids entering the nation 's schools will be minorities .
In other words , the minorities will be the majority , and given the education system 's present performance , that majority will not be equipped by its schooling to meet the job requirements of the 21st century .
As it is , 40 % of engineering-school graduates each year are foreigners , as are the vast majority of those doing post-graduate engineering .
What this says in a country that will need 500,000 new scientists and engineers by 2010 should be obvious .
From whatever perspective you confront the issue , the consequences are devastating .
In the election just ended , the number of people voting as a proportion of those eligible by age to vote failed to go above 50 % for the first time in 64 years .
That stunning failure of civic responsibility should be measured against some Census Bureau calculations on the correlation between educational levels and voter participation in the 1986 midterm elections .
Only among those who had four years of college or more was participation higher than 50 % .
For those with eight years or less of school , it was 40 % and below .
High-school graduates had a 44.1 % level .
Some might argue that this is a good thing , that only the best educated should have a say .
Aside from its anti-democratic bias , that argument ignores the consequences of systematic nonparticipation in politics by a majority of the people .
Among them are the erosion of truly representative government and the creation of a large class of Americans with no stake in , or concern about , the continued success of free , representative institutions .
Perhaps that can be dismissed as idle speculation .
The republic survived a long time with an electorate far smaller as a percentage of the whole than today 's .
But what is not speculative is the impact on our economic future of the failure to retain and educate all our youngsters .
In Japan , children are understood to be the most valuable asset .
The assumption , made manifest in policy and practice , is that all children can and will learn -- and until their middle school years , that they can and will go forward together .
In the U.S. , there is an implicit assumption that some kids just are n't capable of learning .
Consequently , many of them do n't learn or they drop out of formal education altogether -- at an average of 28.5 % between the ninth and 12th grades .
How that stacks up can be measured by the incredible testing disparities between Japanese and American students and in the competitive advantage given to Japanese industry by a well-educated , self-confident work force .
Just as we have recklessly squandered the prodigious natural resources , we squander the greatest natural resource of all -- our children -- and both children and society pay for the waste .
Education in our federal system is and will remain primarily the domain of state and local government .
But the federal government is not without ample precedents for decisive intervention .
Early childhood education in particular is a demonstrated success whose reach should be made universal .
The president 's `` bully pulpit '' -LRB- one of the president-elect 's favorite phrases -RRB- can mobilize the country as readily against ignorance as against any other adversary .
The task is to translate the mound of task-force reports and rhetoric into sustained action .
Without that , the nation is at risk in most of the ways that count .
Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm .

Atlantic Richfield Co. said it signed a long-term licensing agreement with Kyodo Oil for construction of 500 am/pm mini markets at Kyodo-branded gas stations in Japan .
Los Angeles-based Arco said the agreement calls for it to provide operating information on its combination convenience store and gas station formula , as well as use of the am/pm name .
Financial details were n't disclosed .
Kyodo is one of Japan 's largest oil companies , with more than 6,400 service stations .
Some existing stations will be converted to the am/pm format and Kyodo plans to build some new outlets .
The first store is scheduled to open in Tokyo next spring .
Arco has more than 700 am/pm stores , which carry basic grocery items , as well as hamburgers and soft drinks .
The outlets are built on existing gas station sites and are credited with substantially increasing revenue and profit per site for Arco .
The formula is said to be attractive to Kyodo because of rising property values in Japan , leading to demands for higher returns from gas station sites to justify continued operation .
Kyodo will continue to use its own name on the stations but will use the am/pm logo , trading on the attraction of English in the Japanese market .
Plans call for the Japanese am/pm mini markets to be substantially smaller than their U.S. counterparts .
The Japanese versions will range in size from 800 square feet for remodeled locations to 1,500 square feet for new sites .
Arco 's stores run from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet .

Code-Alarm Inc. , a tiny technology company whose stock price has ridden a roller-coaster in recent months , said it postponed a planned public offering .
`` Today 's market conditions in general are inappropriate for our proposed common stock offering , '' Rand Mueller , president and chief executive officer , said in a statement .
`` We will therefore delay the offering until the market price for the company 's shares is more in line with the real worth of Code-Alarm . ''
The company , which is traded over the counter , has seen its stock trade anywhere from $ 4.25 a share to $ 15.375 over the past year .
Its shares shot up this summer after it announced major contracts with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. to sell its automobile security and keyless entry systems .
The contracts total $ 13.3 million , slightly more than Code-Alarm 's sales for all of 1987 .
When it announced the proposed offering in mid-October , it said it expected the new shares -- which would have increased by 50 % its 2.1 million shares outstanding -- to sell for about $ 13 each and yield between $ 11.7 million and $ 13.6 million total .
But the company 's stock has been trading close to $ 9 a share .
It closed in national over-the-counter trading yesterday at $ 9.75 a share , up 50 cents .

Smith Laboratories Inc. said it agreed in principle to sell its Sutter Corp. unit to closely held Rehabilitation Technologies Inc. , of San Diego , for about $ 12 million , primarily in cash and a promissory note .
Sutter makes rehabilitation equipment for knee-surgery and hand-surgery patients , and silicone-joint implants .
Rehabilitation Technologies was founded by William A. Eisenecher , who was president of Sutter until October 1987 .
Smith , which makes , sells and rents medical equipment , said the sale is part of a strategic decision not to pursue additional investment in the rehabilitation business .

Railroad Savings & Loan Association said its directors approved a plan calling for the company to be restructured into a holding company with the thrift becoming a unit of Railroad Financial Corp. .

National Theme Productions , the nation 's biggest Halloween-costume retailer , used to be scared at the prospect of November .
With nearly all its sales tied to Halloween , it could only look forward to this month 's annual post-mortem of costume trends , conducted to prepare managers for a selling season 11 months away .
But this year the closely held San Diego company is taking another holiday for a market .
At counters in about a quarter of the 1,000 Sears , J.C. Penney 's and Montgomery Ward stores where it peddles Halloween costumes , National Theme is selling crystal figurines and jewelry to Christmas shoppers .
It may then keep 50 of those outlets open year-round .
And it is thinking about expanding further into Valentine 's Day and Easter gifts .
National Theme did about $ 26 million of business this Halloween , which it figures accounts for about 10 % of the whole U.S. market .
But like many small companies that have created their own markets in a narrow , seasonal field , National Theme has found itself locked in , its growth restricted and its hiring and training programs strained .
Success of its expansion plan would mean that the current six weeks of selling would grow to six months , doubling the company 's sales , while making far better use of its employees .
`` We need to build a bridge to other seasons , '' says the company 's president , W. Paul Sullivan , who got into the Halloween business selling makeup and costume accessories when he ran a Santa Barbara , Calif. , pharmacy .
`` We already have the locations in the department stores for Halloween , and we have 8,000 temporary workers in place .
We do n't want to have to renew the recruiting effort every season . ''
Under the current structure , swings in employment during the year are drastic and costly .
Most of the year , National Theme operates with a bare-bones staff of about 40 employees , working on marketing strategies or designing costumes for the coming season .
It subcontracts manufacturing work to San Diego and Tijuana garment makers .
By summer , the company is busy recruiting its 120 regional and field managers , often looking to Purdue , Brigham Young and other universities for senior management interns .
The interns , many of whom return each year for more part-time work , earn as much as $ 3,000 for the season .
Managers learn purchasing , marketing , display and hiring techniques during a weeklong seminar in San Diego -- National Theme calls it the `` University of Boo '' -- before returning to their sales areas to negotiate for store locations and recruit and train an 8,000-person temporary sales force .
National Theme was formed in 1985 with the merger of two competing Southern California companies selling costumes at Sears and Penney 's .
It has added about 150 locations a year since then in the U.S. and Canada , while also working to improve its positioning within stores where it already operates .
Department stores themselves handle advertising , eliminating one hefty cost for National Theme .
National Theme claims to have turned a profit each year since 1985 , when it had revenue of about $ 17.3 million .
Executives figure the company 's popularity with department stores reflects a lack of desire by retailers to invest in such a narrow market themselves -- especially with Christmas fast approaching .
Still , the stores are lured by growing Halloween business ; at its busiest locations , National Theme sells as much as $ 5,000 a square foot on an annualized basis .
It pays department stores a percentage of revenues as rent .
The move into crystal started when a Sears concessionaire got out of its trinket-selling business , and the department store asked National Theme to take over .
National Theme has been training managers in the display and sale of the glass items under the tutelage of a former Franklin Mint designer and marketing executive .
`` Selling is our forte .
It does n't really matter if you 're selling Halloween costumes or crystal , '' says National Theme Chairman Paul Thomas .
National Theme acknowledges , though , that selling crystal before Christmas is much more competitive , with specialty gift shops like Hallmark already having a stranglehold on trinket traffic .
`` Crystal is less of a must-buy than Halloween costumes , '' says John Poletto , vice president of operations for National Theme 's crystal division .
`` But we already have a sales staff in place , and very good locations in the host stores that we 're keeping from Halloween . ''
National Theme , which has found that its hottest Halloween costumes are the ones it designs itself , also hopes to apply that lesson to the crystal business .
Next year it will add its own crystal and pewter line to the items on this year 's shelves .
Company executives expect $ 5 million in crystal sales over the next two months .
And by expanding the flow of revenue over other holidays , National Theme will gain a big advantage in financing .
The company now must operate on a bank credit line for most of the year , then pay it down after Halloween .
`` By September , we 're on a negative cash flow , and the bank asks , ' How are you doing ? '
I say lousy , so far , '' jokes National Theme 's president , Mr. Sullivan .
`` With this business , you have to be in it for the long haul . ''

Foote , Cone & Belding Communications Inc. said it adopted a new stockholder-rights plan that it said would provide `` additional protection against coercive or unfair takeover tactics . ''
The ad agency said the plan was n't in response to any known effort to acquire the company .

Boeing Co. said it received a $ 1.1 billion order for 22 commercial aircraft from Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services , the aircraft-leasing joint venture of the Australian concerns TNT Ltd. and News Corp. .
The purchase includes 16 Boeing 757 airplanes , which seat about 220 passengers , and six 767-300 extended-range jetliners , which seat about 250 .
Ansett Worldwide also took options on an additional seven 767 aircraft .
Ansett selected Rolls-Royce PLC 's RB211-535E4 engine for the 757s .
Engine selection for the 767s will be announced later .
Boeing , the Seattle-based aircraft and defense contracting concern , will begin delivering the 757s in October 1990 , with further deliveries extending into 1995 .
Deliveries of the 767s will begin in October 1990 and continue through 1993 .
Ansett Worldwide will have the right to substitute the standard -200 or -300 series for the 767 extended-range airplanes , in order to meet the requirements of the leasing market , Boeing said .
The transaction brings total orders for Boeing 's 757 aircraft to 387 , close to what industry obervers say is the break-even point of 400 orders for the 757 model .
To date this year , 148 of the 757s have been ordered , compared with 37 a year earlier .
The Ansett Worldwide order brings total 767 orders to 353 , with 76 ordered for the year to date , compared with 55 a year ago .
So far this year , a total of 595 Boeing jetliners of all models have been ordered , with a total value of $ 28 billion , compared with 321 airplanes valued at $ 16.5 billion for the same period last year .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Boeing shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 60.875 .

European airlines ' August passenger traffic in Western Europe grew by 7 % from a year earlier , according to the Association of European Airlines .
The rise matched similar rates of growth in July and June , indicating that the rise in passenger traffic for the full year in Europe would be close to 7.5 % , the 21-member association said .
`` Such a volume of growth . . . is putting considerable strain on airport and air-traffic-control facilities , '' the association said in a statement .
The association said flight delays in Europe eased slightly in August , but it forecast the improvement would n't last .
It said 20.7 % of short-haul and medium-distance flights were delayed by at least 15 minutes , lower than 28.6 % of such flights delayed in July .
Long-haul passenger traffic rose by 6.2 % in August , a stronger growth rate than the rise of 4 % in July .

Jefferies Group Inc. named valuation analyst William M. Smith to the newly created post of managing director and senior vice president , institutional research sales , and signed an exclusive agreement to market the services of his former firm .
The 45-year-old Mr. Smith , with his wife , Linda Zimbalist Smith , founded the Westport , Conn. , firm of Zimbalist Smith in 1982 .
The move by Jefferies marks an expansion of the brokerage concern 's emphasis on the institutional investment side of its business .
`` It represents our commitment to the institutional market , '' said Frank E. Baxter , Jefferies 's president and chief executive .
`` A number of brokerages have pulled back from institutional but we believe there is a lot of potential in that marketplace . ''
Mr. Smith , 45 years old , said his primary responsibility will be to market Jefferies 's investment products and services to portfolio managers , and high on the list of services will be the valuations offered by Zimbalist Smith .
Zimbalist Smith specializes in identifying undervalued companies that are likely targets for takeovers , buy-outs or restructurings , and assigning values to each of the possible outcomes .
In one recent study of stocks that were the subject of takeover rumors , the firm espouses selling rumored takeover stocks when they reach 75 % of their merger value .
Mrs. Smith will continue to run Zimbalist Smith , and Mr. Smith said he is now unaffiliated with the firm `` except by marriage . ''
The marketing agreement with Jefferies runs through the end of next year , and is renewable thereafter .
Zimbalist Smith previously had marketed its services through W&D Securities , which provided execution services to Jefferies .
Mr. Smith served as president of W&D until his appointment to the new post at Jefferies on Oct. 1 .
`` This is a recognition on Jefferies part that the institution can come to the company for both investment advice as well as Jefferies 's highly-regarded execution ability '' on securities trades , Mr. Smith said .
Jefferies specializes in block-trading in the so-called `` third market , '' away from the major exchanges .
Jefferies was founded by Boyd L. Jefferies , who pleaded guilty to two felony counts in April 1987 after being implicated in unlawful trading by stock speculator Ivan Boesky .
Mr. Jefferies , who resigned from the firm in 1987 , helped the government in its investigation of securities-law violations and was given a suspended sentence and fined $ 250,000 in July .

Air Wis Services Inc. said September traffic at its Air Wisconsin unit dropped 3 % to 34.8 million revenue passenger miles from 35.9 million a year earlier .
A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile .
Air Wisconsin operates as United Express , a feeder commuter service affiliated with UAL Corp. 's United Airlines .
The unit 's load factor , or percentage of seats filled , dropped to 44 % from 48.4 % .
For the first nine months this year , Air Wisconsin 's traffic was up 1.6 % to 325.5 million revenue passenger miles from 320.5 million .
Year-to-date load factor slipped to 47.3 % from 49.6 % .

Resolution Funding Corp. said the auction of its securities to finance the savings-and-loan bailout will begin Oct. 25 .
Meanwhile , an important lawmaker is trying to thwart a plan by the new thrift-bailout agency , Resolution Trust Corp. , to raise other working capital .
Resolution Funding Corp. will issue $ 30 billion in bonds over the next two years , backed by zero-coupon Treasury securities financed by contributions from the S&L industry .
The amounts and maturity of the first Refcorp auction will n't be announced until Wednesday .
Refcorp said the bonds will n't be subject to redemption prior to maturity , unless it designates those terms for a particular series of bonds .
Refcorp also said the bonds may be stripped into their separate interest and principal components .
In addition , the Resolution Trust Corp. , the new agency that will close or merge sick thrifts , will also require working capital to carry the assets of failed S&Ls until they can be sold .
The most likely way to raise that capital , RTC officials say , would be for the agency to create a private thrift or bank under its supervision .
That institution would acquire assets from the sick thrifts under government control , and then issue a security to the public , backed by the assets .
Such a mechanism would keep the spending of those funds from adding to the federal budget deficit .
But the RTC plan violates the intent of Congress in its massive savings-and-loan bailout law , said Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y. -RRB- , an influential member of the House Banking Committee .
Yesterday , he sent Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady a letter vehemently objecting to such a plan , saying it shows `` a complete disregard for the integrity of the budget process . ''
Mr. Schumer said the notes issued by such an RTC thrift would require a higher interest rate that of regular Treausry debt .
Moreover , he said Congress intended to allow RTC to issue a certain amount of debt only to the acquirers of sick S&Ls -- not the public .
Officials of RTC said the agency probably will n't decide how to raise the capital for another week or so .

The Oakland Athletics are in the World Series , so I thought I 'd ring up my buddy , Jose Canseco .
Jose , the A's slugger , was nice enough to give me his phone number .
It 's 1-900-234-JOSE .
A call costs $ 2 for the first minute and $ 1 for each succeeding minute , but , what the heck , the guy makes only $ 1.6 million a year playing baseball , so who can begrudge him a few bucks ?
Riiiing .
Riiiing .
`` Hi .
This is Jose Canseco .
Thanks for calling my hotline .
If you 'd like to hear about the latest game and my personal life , press one .
If you want to hear me discuss steroids , fast cars and my ownership of guns , press two . ''
Steroids ?
Fast cars ?
Guns ?
Why would I want to hear about them ?
I pressed one .
`` Well , we 're the American League champs , '' Jose began chattily , and for a couple of minutes rehashed Sunday 's 4-3 playoff win over Toronto that clinched the pennant for his team .
The Blue Jays `` played us pretty tough '' and the victory was `` pretty thrilling , '' he said .
Pretty interesting , huh ?
Then he got to the personal stuff .
After the final out Sunday , `` I expected the crowd to scream and go berserk , but they booed , '' he said .
`` I forgot we were playing in Toronto .
It was strange to celebrate with people booing . ''
But the A's celebrated anyway .
`` We all jumped around and stepped on each other 's feet .
Somebody stepped on my big toe and it still hurts .
We got to the clubhouse , where the champagne was waiting .
We call it ' so ' because it 's sooo bad .
It 's the worst champagne in the world .
It gives you heartburn .
But we used it mostly to spray each other .
`` On the flight home , everybody was drinking and making jokes .
Some of the wives got together and acted like cheerleaders .
Boy , were they bad .
They 'd been drinking , too .
You should have been there .
It was a great time . ''
Boy , I wish I had been there .
But what about the Series against the National League champion San Francisco Giants , Jose ?
`` I 'm glad we 're playing the Giants .
No more plane flights and hotels .
The food on the road is really bad .
I always come home feeling weak , like Manute Bol .
I 'm going to the gym right after this .
`` As for the Giants , you can forget about them .
We 're gonna beat them .
In spring training , they only won one or two out of 10 from us .
We feel this is our year . ''
Forget about the Giants ?
Oooo .
Those are fighting words , the kind that get pasted on locker-room walls .
Call the coming Series `` The Fray by the Bay . ''
Who needs Don King when home boys tangle ?
Actually , this Series might need a bit of hype for anyone living east of Stockton , Calif. .
In keeping with the tenets of my profession I intend to be neutral , but it seems clear that factors of sentiment , which never are to be underestimated in matters of rooting , favor the A's .
I do n't say this out of lack of affection for San Francisco , a beautiful city that 's hard to fault except on geological grounds , but Oakland is a town with true underdog appeal .
If you can forget Gertrude Stein 's quip -LRB- `` There 's no there there '' -RRB- , which Oaklanders would like to do , it 's been ignored by poets and songwriters even as its snazzier neighbor has been celebrated .
No one sings about leaving his heart in Oakland , although Al Davis might have left his hat there , and no pilgrim to California ever pleaded for the state to open up its Bay Bridge .
Oakland 's baseball representatives have shared this wallflower status .
The 1972-74 A's , arguably baseball 's best team of the last three decades , won championships while averaging under one million in annual home attendance , and the franchise was thought to be shaky until quite recently .
Truth to tell , the same held for the Giants , who , when they were looking for a new stadium to replace windy Candlestick Park a few years back , considered one in Denver .
But Bay Area baseball began to revive when the 1987 Giants won a divisional title , and picked up further with the A's pennant last season .
This year , en route to the first Subway Series since the New York Yankees-Brooklyn Dodgers match of 1956 , the two teams together topped the 4.5 million mark at the gate .
They did it with lineups that are mirror images of one another .
Strength is neither team 's weakness , as they showed in their four-games-to-one playoff triumphs over the Blue Jays and Chicago Cubs .
The A's bashed seven home runs against the Blue Jays , including a shot by Canseco into the upper reaches of the Toronto Skydome that had to be tracked by NORAD .
The Giants clubbed eight against the Cubs , and three of them supplied game-winning runs .
There 's little to choose between Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' strong boys , and Canseco , Mark McGwire and Dave Parker , the A's chief flexers , except that the Oakland trio has more hair to comb .
Suffice it to say that people with Series bleacher seats would be well advised to wear hard hats .
I have no idea who 's going to win , but I can provide a few historical guidelines .
The teams met in three previous World 's Series in their New York and Philadelphia incarnations , with the Giants winning once , in 1905 , and the A's twice , in 1911 and '13 .
The Ex-Cub Factor , which favors the team with the fewest ex-Cubs , is a standoff at two each , with the A's Dennis Eckersley and Ron Hassey canceling out the Giants ' Craig Lefferts and Rick Reuschel .
Without wishing to appear Chicago-centric , I must point out that another Windy City-based measure gives a perhaps-decisive nod to the Giants .
Three times this year , Chicago teams -LRB- the football Bears , basketball Bulls and hockey Black Hawks -RRB- have lost in the semifinals of their respective playoffs , and the teams that beat them went on to win titles .
Make that four if you include the University of Illinois basketball team in the NCAAs .
You could look it up .

Assets of the nation 's 470 money market mutual funds increased $ 899.9 million in the week ended Wednesday to a record $ 349.89 billion .

The battlefield of politics is like the battlefield of war ; old tactics rarely win new battles .
If the results from California over the past two years are any indication , the victorious tacticians for the 1990 elections will be the Democrats .
Traditionally , urban voters received electoral information via the political machine .
The machine won votes by having precinct captains talk to each voter in a neighborhood about his problems and get city government to solve those problems .
Since the rise of suburbs and electronic media , however , it has become cheaper for candidates to contact voters without going through a machine .
But necessarily this has led to mass , not individual , appeals .
Now California Democrats are revolutionizing campaigns for legislative office in large districts .
They are using grass-roots volunteers and paid precinct captains to ask voters about partisan preferences , positions on important issues , and basic demographic information .
These findings then are used to run separate campaigns among groups of voters , tailored to push individuals ' hot-buttons .
Direct mail , telephone banks and precinct walkers are used to tell a voter that the Democratic candidate agrees with his views on the one or two issues most important to that voter .
Once a voter tells a volunteer that he supports the party hopeful , Democrats produce an absentee-ballot application for the voter and maintain contact until he returns the ballot .
The Democrats now can run powerful campaigns that , because they are targeted so selectively , go unnoticed -- and thus uncountered -- until after the voters have decided .
Since each voter hears exactly what he wants to hear , each has little reason not to vote Democratic .
These new tactics were displayed most recently in the special congressional election to succeed Majority Whip Tony Coelho -LRB- D. , Modesto -RRB- .
Democratic State Assemblyman Gary Condit won with 57 % of the vote .
An astounding 40 % of his votes came from absentee ballots -LRB- 10 % would normally be high -RRB- .
Democratic managers said they had delivered 24,000 absentee-ballot applications , and that 20,000 -- 80 % -- were returned .
With more than 100,000 Democrats registered to vote in this district , it 's clear that the managers mailed the ballots only to pre-selected Democrats .
Former Gov. Jerry Brown , chairman of the state Democratic Party , boasted after the Condit victory , `` When the Republican mud began to roll through the streets of Modesto it was too late because one-third of the Democrats had already voted . ''
Other examples of this system at work :
-- 1988 -- Michael Dukakis almost won California , losing only 51 % to 48 % .
The Almanac of American Politics says that `` the Democrats ' strategy -LCB- was -RCB- to reinvent the precinct organization. . . .
The Democrats ' organizational efforts were probably worth a couple of points. . . . ''
Tactics worth `` a couple of points '' in a presidential race will be worth more in less visible legislative races .
Not surprisingly , two GOP Assembly incumbents were defeated for re-election in California that November , the first Republican Assembly incumbents defeated in the state since 1980 .
-- 1989 -- `` Pro-choice '' Republican Tricia Hunter of the San Diego area defeated a `` pro-life '' Republican by 100 votes in a special Assembly primary , largely because of a phone and computer campaign run courtesy of Democratic Speaker Willie Brown 's political operatives .
The operatives identified pro-choice Democrats and emphasized the abortion issue among them . -LRB- Special-election procedures allow cross-party voting. -RRB- In a district where 33 % of the voters are registered Democrats , the only Democratic candidate on the ballot received 6.6 % ; the remainder voted for Ms. Hunter .
California has long led the nation in political marketing , so these results are of national significance .
Indeed , the techniques already appear to be spreading .
In another special election last month , for Jim Wright 's congressional seat in Texas , the GOP candidate `` won on Election Day , '' as they say , but lost the race when now-Rep .
Preston Geren carved out a 3,000-vote margin in the absentee ballots , which constituted 20 % of the total cast .
Why have Republicans , traditionally the leaders in election technology , been caught flat-footed ?
They 're the victims of complacency born of past success , and they 've tended to farm out work to consultants instead of centralizing campaign commands as these tactics require .
Meantime , Democrats , seeing defeats occur when marginal constituencies switched parties , had more of an incentive to plot a way to check that slippage .
Now the GOP will be lucky to get a rudimentary counter-apparatus in gear by next year 's off-year balloting .
This new system effectively recreates the political machine for legislative races in districts sufficiently large that standard door-to-door contact or an existing personal following are n't sufficient to secure victory for a candidate .
A computer makes communication cost-efficient by creating tiny clusters of people who share preferences , each cluster receiving the same campaign .
Sound far-fetched ?
Jerry Brown does n't think so .
He crowed after the Condit win : `` The message ?
The machine is the message .
We are building the machine .
And when the party is powerful enough , we can pick candidates and hold them accountable . ''
Individual candidates cannot afford the machinery needed to create this voting weapon .
Candidates in large legislative districts will quickly learn what their grandfathers knew in the 1930s -- to get elected , candidates will have to obey the party bosses .
Gary Hart , meet Mayor Daley .
Boss Tweed , meet Boss Brown .

A House subcommittee approved a measure that would require telephone companies to provide special devices that enable deaf people to use the telephone .
The House telecommunications and finance subcommittee voted unanimously for the requirement , as part of a broader measure that would ban discrimination against the handicapped in employment , public accommodations , transportation , and communications .
The Commerce Committee panel was the first on the House side to vote on any part of the bill .
Three other House committees , including the Labor , Judiciary and Public Works panels , are also considering provisions of the bill , which has strong Bush administration support .
The Senate approved its version last month .
The telephone provision , similar to one contained in the Senate measure , would give phone companies three years to provide relay systems permitting linkups between deaf persons and telephone voice conversations .
Simple computers would allow deaf callers to use a keyboard to send messages to an operator , who would then relay them by spoken or similar teletype message to another person .
The operator also could relay telephone voice messages by teletype to a deaf person .
The bill would allow telephone companies to recover costs of the service through general rate making , but would prohibit monthly surcharges for all phone users in interstate service .
Deaf users could n't be forced to bear the full cost .
The service is estimated to add three cents a month to residential phones rates .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. generally supports the measure ; it provides such service in Alabama , California and New York , and has a similar plan for Illinois .

Precious metals futures prices rose on a report , later denied , that certain Japanese insurance companies were being allowed to buy more precious metals than they previously could .
Gold for December delivery advanced $ 1.30 an ounce to $ 367.40 , December silver was up one cent an ounce to $ 5.1530 , and January platinum gained $ 5.20 an ounce to $ 491.50 .
Demand for contracts followed a news service report from Tokyo that gold , platinum and silver futures prices surged after the Japanese News Agency said Japanese non-life insurers were buying precious metals .
The news agency said the buying was a result of a government ruling allowing the companies to increase their precious metals holdings .
Subsequently , Knight-Ridder Inc. , which had relayed the Japanese News Agency report , said Tokyo officials rejected that report as `` unjustified . ''
Traders in Tokyo said the Japanese News Agency story led some to believe a rule allowing the insurers to put 3 % of their investment portfolios into precious metals represented an increase , Knight-Ridder said .
In fact , the 3 % maximum has been in effect for more than a year , Knight-Ridder said .
Knight-Ridder quoted traders as saying Japanese officials might have simply urged the insurers to bring their precious metals holdings up to the 3 % limit to help combat the dollar 's current rise .
Knight-Ridder said the officials indicated that insurers ' precious metals holdings are below the maximum allowed .
They did n't disclose specific levels .
The buying sparked by the original news report had the strongest effect on platinum because of a Japanese affinity for that metal , and it had a smaller effect on gold , said William O' Neill , vice president , research , for Elders Futures Inc. in New York .
Silver edged up slightly in sympathy with the other two metals , he said .
`` It is n't likely these companies are going to rush out to buy platinum and gold simply because the government is encouraging them to do so , '' Mr. O' Neill said .
`` They still have a sour taste in their mouths from the last time they bought precious metals in substantial quantities and the market was unable to hold advances .
As a result , they 're holding platinum and gold in their portfolios that are showing losses . ''
Mr. O' Neill said buying of precious metals by these insurers is `` only a minor factor in the long-term scheme of things . ''
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices closed higher , continuing the week 's strong showing on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery closed 22 cents higher at $ 20.47 a barrel .
Heating oil finished the session higher , but November contracts for unleaded gasoline fell 0.16 of a cent to 55.57 cents a gallon .
Analysts and traders cited a large increase in U.S. gasoline supplies , as measured weekly by the American Petroleum Institute .
Gasoline for later delivery rose in price .
Market participants seemed to ignore the institute 's statistics that showed somewhat higher crude oil inventories and held onto their optimism of the past several sessions , moving prices higher in light trading .
COPPER : Futures prices rose on reports that a production disruption at a major U.S. refinery would delay shipments .
The December contract advanced 1.75 cents a pound to $ 1.3035 .
The production problem at the Magma Copper Co. plant in San Manuel , Ariz. , was described by a company spokesman as minor and temporary .
The spokesman said a failure in the refinery 's electrolytic system a week ago caused material to accumulate on a group of cathodes , or sheets of copper , so that they did n't meet certain specifications .
The problem has been discovered and corrected , he said , and it will take about a week for the system to return to normal .
The spokesman said the problem affected only one batch of cathodes with special specifications .
`` The copper is perfectly fine otherwise and can be sold elsewhere , '' he said .
In any case , he said , there is nothing wrong with the plant , which is in full production .
`` We called a force majeure for an indefinite time to protect ourselves in this specific case until we can resume normal shipments , '' he said .
A declaration of force majeure refers to an inability to meet a contractual agreement because of forces beyond the shipper 's control .
ORANGE JUICE : Futures prices were slightly higher in thin trading ahead of a government crop report .
The November contract rose 0.75 of a cent a pound to $ 1.3705 .
After the close of trading , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , in its first estimate of the Florida orange crop for the season beginning Dec. 1 , said production will amount to 130 million boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes in the current season .
A box is 90 pounds .
The projection was near the low end of estimates , which ranged between 125 million and 150 million boxes , said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , New York .
Although prices are likely to rise today on the basis of the low estimate , she said , the advance `` should be short-lived '' because of expectations that Brazilian shipments of concentrate will fill a supply gap estimated at around 20 million gallons .
Brazilian shipments had been delayed but are expected to begin arriving in large volumes soon , according to Ms. Ganes .
She said this flow of juice into the U.S. could weigh on prices because it will be coming just before the start of the Florida harvest .
Ms. Ganes also said that now that the Florida estimate is out of the way , Brazilian processors are likely to cut prices to stimulate consumption of their product , which is expected to be in plentiful supply .

The inspector general 's office of the Health and Human Services Department said it is conducting a criminal investigation of Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. for possible `` false information '' concerning applications to manufacture at least two generic drugs and other matters .
The investigation was confirmed by Judy Holtz , a spokeswoman at the inspector general 's office .
She said the case has been discussed with the U.S. attorney 's office in Baltimore , which has been leading a criminal probe of the generic drug industry that has already resulted in several convictions .
But so far , she said , the U.S. attorney has n't decided to act on the case , and the case has n't been presented to a grand jury .
On news of the investigation on the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report news wire , Bolar shares fell $ 1.875 to $ 17 in American Stock Exchange composite trading on volume of 1.2 million shares .
Specifically , Ms. Holtz said the criminal investigation involves possible false information concerning Bolar 's drug applications for its version of Dyazide , a blood pressure medicine , and its version of Macrodantin , a urinary tract antibiotic .
Together , those two drugs represent an estimated 50 % of Bolar 's annual sales .
Bolar also is under investigation about circumstances surrounding the company 's use of a brand name anti-psychotic drug as Bolar 's product in outside laboratory testing in 1982 .
However , FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said he believed the criminal statute of limitation had already expired and that Bolar could n't be charged in connection with that drug testing .
The company has said that was an inadvertent mix-up .
On Monday , Bolar President Robert Shulman said the company had n't been informed that it was the target of a criminal probe .
Ms. Holtz said Mr. Shulman was interviewed Tuesday by an investigator from the inspector general 's office and a representative of the Food and Drug Administration .
Yesterday Mr. Shulman was out of the country on business and could n't be reached .
Patricia Shukri , vice president at Bolar , said an outside lawyer for the company learned of the probe yesterday but did n't get any details .
Gary Jordan , an assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore in charge of the generic drug probe , declined to comment about Bolar .
He said his office has a policy of not confirming or denying criminal investigations .
Earlier this week Bolar voluntarily recalled its 100mg version of the urinary tract antibiotic , then it expanded the recall to the 50mg capsules of the same drug .
Combined , those two versions of Macrodantin represent about 10 % of Bolar 's total annual sales .
Macrodantin is made by Norwich Eaton , a unit of Procter & Gamble Co. of Cincinnati .
Bolar had said the FDA presented evidence suggesting that Bolar passed off Macrodantin as its own to obtain government clearance to market a generic version .
Bolar denied the accusation and said an outside firm would audit its drug applications to clear the matter .
As previously reported , the FDA issued a statement in August saying it did n't have any evidence of fraud in Bolar 's application for its version of Dyazide , which is made by SmithKline Beecham PLC .
Afterwards , however , FDA Commissioner Frank Young said Bolar had n't been exonerated of suspicions that it substituted the brand name product as its own to gain governmental approval to market a generic version of Dyazide .
Mr. Nesbit , the FDA spokesman , said the agency continues to investigate .
Bolar 's version of Dyazide remains the sole generic on the market , but the FDA has downgraded the product so that it 's no longer considered the therapeutic equivalent of the SmithKline product .

The state of Bavaria is ready to sell its 35.45 % interest in tank maker Krauss-Maffei AG , the Bavarian finance minister said .
Speaking to journalists in Munich , Gerold Tandler also indicated that engineering concern Mannesmann AG is the main candidate to acquire the stake , and perhaps take majority control of the group .
Mr. Tandler said there have been talks , but no formal negotiations , about the sale of the shares .
Earlier this week , Mannesmann said it is considering taking a stake in Munich-based Krauss-Maffei provided the ownership structure of the latter changed .

IN 1971 , THE U.S. HAD ITS FIRST TRADE DEFICIT since 1888 .
It began a headache that will n't go away .
Surging imports of Japanese cars and TV sets , European goods , Middle Eastern oil and other-nation raw materials topped U.S. exports by $ 2.05 billion .
Just the prior year the U.S. had a trade surplus of $ 2.7 billion .
The out-of-kilter trade had caused President Nixon on Aug. 15 to slap -- briefly -- a 10 % surcharge on goods accounting for about half the $ 45 billion annual imports then . -LRB- He also allowed the dollar to float freely , unpegged to gold , against foreign currencies .
Overvalued dollars , high U.S. oil imports and Japanese competition were the main culprits for U.S. trade imbalances . -RRB-
`` Made in the U.S.A. '' lost its luster , and protectionist pressure rose .
Treasury Secretary John Connally as early as the prior May -- the first time in more than 20 years that U.S. trade was in the red two months in a row -- said the U.S. should `` get tough '' with its trading partners .
Britain , Canada and other nations beefed about the 10 % surcharge , claiming it was illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
Nixon killed it on Dec. 20 , 1971 , as he devalued the dollar by raising the official gold price 8.57 % .
Trade deficits have been recorded for the past 13 years in a row .
The figure will be more than $ 100 billion this year , analysts say , compared with $ 118 billion in 1988 and the record $ 152 billion in 1987 .
Rightly or wrongly , but not necessarily rationally , currency traders and others use the monthly figures as an excuse to buy or sell if the deficit is more or less than predictions , notes a Commerce Department official .

When Woody Allen ponders the universe it 's funny .
Yet his special comic talent does n't seem to satisfy him -- and maybe it could n't after all the movies he 's made .
In recent years he 's felt compelled to be more `` serious , '' to take the nagging questions that have given his comedy its edge and to ask them straight .
He 's been using this method , which he first experimented with years ago in `` Interiors , '' in what he calls his `` ensemble pieces . ''
These pictures -- notably `` Hannah and Her Sisters , '' `` September , '' `` Another Woman '' -- have been extremely polished works , all very beautiful and all unsatisfying in varying degrees .
In these problematic films , Mr. Allen has assigned other people the job of giving serious articulation to the angst that elsewhere so hilariously perfuses his Woody Allen screen personality .
These glum Allen surrogates usually sound hopelessly mannered , like people translating a foreign language with words that are technically correct but that miss the spirit of the original .
That 's why Mr. Allen 's funny short film , `` Oedipus Wrecks '' -- his one-third of this spring 's `` New York Stories '' omnibus -- seemed like a reward to those who dutifully sat through `` September '' and `` Another Woman . ''
Comedy probably does n't feel like serious work to him anymore , but it 's a rare treat for the rest of us , who recently have been putting up with an eversteadier diet of his ethereal ensembles .
And since Mr. Allen 's new `` Crimes and Misdemeanors '' came officially tagged with the dread E word , I was n't whistling on my way to the screening room .
But either his determination to succeed in this genre is wearing me down , or this picture really is more enjoyable than its predecessors .
Though he does n't have much new to say about the lumpen-intellectual New York world on whose fringes he operates , this time around he 's put a neat , cynical twist on his characters ' labored musings about love and death and morality .
As usual , he 's divvied up the concerns that used to belong to him , back when he was his main and best character , among a number of different characters .
Like Mr. Allen , all of them are maneuvering their way through middle age , though none of them have much of a sense of humor about the passage .
He certainly knows these people .
And he 's perfectly captured their look and manner with Sven Nykvist 's elegant cinematography .
At the center of their overlapping stories is Judah Rosenthal -LRB- Martin Landau -RRB- , a familiar type -- a successful physician who 's also a philanthropist , also knowledgeable about art and music , also possessor of a lovely wife and daughter .
Judah 's perfection , his smug acceptance of his fine lot in life , would be almost unbearable if he did n't have a big headache on his hands .
She 's Dolores -LRB- Anjelica Huston -RRB- , his neurotic airline-hostess mistress who 's tired of being Madame X .
Her power over Judah is enormous because only she can expose his hypocrisy .
While Judah figures out how to dispose of this problem , many other relationships are built , while others fall apart .
By far the most compelling figures are Cliff , the documentary film maker played by Mr. Allen , and his fancy TV producer brother-in-law Lester , played by Alan Alda .
Mr. Allen supplies the comic relief and Mr. Alda provides the surprise .
He 's not the least bit ingratiating here , in a nicely nasty portrait of the vain , slick exercise of power , Hollywood style .
The cast includes many Allen reliables , including Mia Farrow and Sam Waterston , and they are reliable .
There are a few cameo appearances by Allen-film newcomers , too , notably by the blonde actress Darryl Hannah and the brunette writer Nora Ephron .
The film also provides the bluntest blunt expression of Mr. Allen 's sour vision of life since `` Stardust Memories , '' a cynicism that usually is disguised by his nostalgia and his romanticizing angle of vision on architecture , music and women .

I never managed to like `` Breaking In '' quite as much as I wanted to like it .
One wants to feel warmly toward a film that has a faded stud like Burt Reynolds playing the part of a codger , an old thief , with the greatest dexterity and charm .
He 's just wonderful .
The rest of the film is n't bad , just pokey about getting to a payoff that does n't really exist .
Still , there is a sweetness to this tale of an experienced burglar who tries to teach a new thief old tricks .
Mr. Reynolds , jowly and limping , has a marvelous sense of the way a certain kind of precise older man goes about his business , whether he 's an engineer or an editor or a thief .
He loves what he does because he does it well , and he does n't expend much energy rhapsodizing about it or even spending the money he steals .
He 's a prudent man , saves what he needs and spends the rest on his few luxuries -- including his steady `` girlfriend , '' the hooker he 's rented regularly for a year .
He stumbles across his protege , when they bump into each other trying to rob the same house .
The kid is played by Casey Siemaszko , the pudding-faced young actor who 's appeared in `` Stand By Me , '' `` Back to the Future '' and `` Gardens of Stone . ''
Though the chemistry between them seems right , not much happens .
That 's the style of Scottish director Bill Forsyth -LRB- `` Local Hero , '' `` Gregory 's Girl , '' `` Housekeeping '' -RRB- , and usually the whimsical incidentals along the way make the trip a treat , even if you do n't get anywhere .
But the director worked here with a script by John Sayles , whose considerable talents do n't include whimsy .
It 's hard to tell who was leading whom , but in any case the dance does n't go smoothly and seems to take a very long time .
---
VIDEO TIP : Mr. Forsyth knows how to pick his Burts , but he does n't treat them all the same .
Burt Lancaster starred in Mr. Forsyth 's most magical film , `` Local Hero , '' about a Scottish town that charms the businessmen who come to corrupt it .
Not a missed step here .

Canadian housing starts rose 9.6 % in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 216,000 from an August rate of 197,000 , Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. , a federal agency , said .
The agency attributed the September increase mainly to a sharp rise in construction of rental and condominium dwellings in the Vancouver and Montreal areas .

Sir Colin Chandler , 50 years old , was named managing director for this British defense and automobiles group .
Sir Colin , who was transferred in 1985 from British Aerospace PLC to the Ministry of Defense , succeeds Ron Taylor , who will retire in April 1990 .

Societe Generale de Belgique SA -LRB- SGB -RRB- , Belgium 's largest holding company , increased its stake in its banking affiliate , Generale de Banque , to nearly 20 % , a spokesman for SGB said .
That is up from a holding of 13 % at year end 1988 .
The spokesman confirmed a report in the Belgian financial daily De Tijd that the holding company recently had bought a 5 % block of Generale de Banque shares sold by Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV -LRB- Amro -RRB- .
The spokesman said SGB 's holding in Generale de Banque now amounts to 19.44 % .
Amro and Generale de Banque announced they would reduce their 10 % cross-shareholdings by half after merger talks between the two broke down in September .
The SGB spokesman did n't say at what price the Generale de Belgique shares were bought .

Max & Erma 's Restaurants Inc. said it completed the sale of 520,000 shares of its common stock for about $ 2.9 million .
The stock was sold to holders of common stock purchase warrants that expired Oct. 7 , the restaurant operator said .
With the sale , the company has slightly more than three million common shares outstanding .
The bulk of the proceeds will be invested and used to fund growth beyond 1990 , the company said .

Dalgety PLC , a British food and agricultural products company , said it has exited food commodities trading with the sale of its Gill & Duffus unit for # 87.4 million -LRB- $ 135.9 million -RRB- .
Gill & Duffus , which Dalgety acquired in 1985 , was sold off in four parts to a combination of management and outside investors .
Dalgety did n't disclose individual proceeds of the sale .
Maurice Warren , Dalgety 's managing director , said the company sold its Gill & Duffus trading units to focus on downstream operations in food manufacturing and agribusiness .
He added that the move was largely a response to unpredictable earnings from the highly volatile and cyclical commodity markets , which had eroded returns from Gill & Duffus during the five years that Dalgety controlled the international trading and brokerage company .

Pier 1 Imports Inc. , a specialty retailer , said its September sales rose 26 % to $ 47.1 million from $ 37.5 million .
The company said sales rose 7 % at stores open for more than a year .

I appreciated Thomas W. Hazlett 's review of my book , `` The Farm Fiasco '' -LRB- `` Bushels of Dough , '' Leisure & Arts , Sept. 21 -RRB- .
However , it had numerous errors .
Mr. Hazlett states that farmers `` are ever close to the margin . ''
This is very misleading : Agriculture Department studies show that the average full-time farmer has a net worth of more than $ 1 million -LRB- more than 12 times higher than that of the average American family -RRB- .
The average full-time farmer enjoyed a farm income of $ 136,255 in 1987 .
Full-time farmers have had far higher incomes than average Americans throughout the 1980s .
The comparative wealth of farmers was a major point of my book ; I 'm surprised Mr. Hazlett missed it .
Mr. Hazlett characterizes farm landowners as `` typically . . . rich Republican country clubbers who regularly denounce welfare handouts over gin-and-tonics . ''
This may be true around Davis , Calif. , where Mr. Hazlett resides , but that is definitely not the case in Kansas , Iowa , South Dakota , etc. Midwest farmers may be wealthy , but they are not `` country club '' types -- and they prefer beer and whiskey over gin-and-tonics .
Mr. Hazlett 's caricature is a libel on most farmers .
Mr. Hazlett implies -LRB- in his statements that farmers `` are ever close to the margin '' while landowners are rich country clubbers -RRB- that there is little overlap between farmers and farm landowners .
In reality , a substantial majority of farmers own the land they plant .
Thus , farmers have reaped most of the benefits of the federally induced rise in farmland values .
Mr. Hazlett contrasts farm programs under Presidents Carter and Reagan : `` ag subsidies had fallen to just $ 4 billion annually under Carter , but have totaled $ 260 billion in the '80s . ''
But the $ 4 billion figure under Mr. Carter counts only government outlays , while the $ 260 billion figure counts both government outlays and higher food costs to consumers caused by federal policies .
Adding consumer costs to the Carter figure would produce a total cost of about $ 12 billion to $ 15 billion , and would weaken Mr. Hazlett 's efforts to blame Republicans for soaring farm spending .
He observes , `` The specific aim of recent Republican reforms is to shift the subsidies off-budget , imposing supply controls in USDA-sponsored cartels to raise commodity prices without direct subsidies .
Consider the 1983-84 PIK program. . . . ''
But under the PIK program , government did not impose involuntary controls on farmers and there was no cartel effort involved .
Many farmers who stayed out of the PIK program reaped huge profits .
The term `` supply controls '' usually refers to mandatory controls imposed by government on farmers .
Actually , most Republicans in Congress have fought tooth and nail to avoid supply controls , while the Democrats -LRB- Gephardt , Harkin , etc. -RRB- have led the push to impose mandatory controls .
The House -LRB- though not the Senate -RRB- voted in favor of mandatory controls in 1986 : Probably six times as many Democrats as Republicans favored mandatory controls .
Both the Reagan administration and the Bush administration have been adamant in their opposition to mandatory controls .

Lyphomed Inc. plans to distribute for free to indigent patients an aerosol drug that can prevent a type of pneumonia that kills as many as 80 % of all AIDS patients .
The drug manufacturer has been considering the idea of free distribution for the last couple of months , but decided to give aerosol pentamidine at no charge only to patients who can n't afford it , said John N. Kapoor , chairman of the Rosemont , Ill. , company .
Dispersals should begin within a week , Mr. Kapoor said .
It was n't clear , however , how the drug will be distributed or how many patients it would effect .
The target group will include patients whose insurance policies do n't cover the cost of the drug , Mr. Kapoor said .
The move follows months of criticism by AIDS activists who accused the company of profiteering .
Typically , aerosol pentamidine costs about $ 100 for a 300 milligram dose taken once a month .
The drug , along with Burroughs Wellcome Co. 's AZT , is credited with helping prolong the lives of people with AIDS .
Last summer , the Food and Drug Administration granted approval for aerosol pentamidine , which staves off both first attacks and recurrences of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , a deadly AIDS-related form of the illness .
Lyphomed currently is the sole supplier of the drug .
As a so-called orphan drug , or one aimed at a small market , aerosol pentamidine is protected by a seven-year exclusive patent .
Lyphomed 's closest rival is a British company , Fisons PLC , which has submitted its own research to the FDA , but has n't yet gotten approval .
Candidates for the drug are AIDS patients whose count on T-helper lymphocytes , cells vital to the immune system , falls below 200 per cubic millimeter of blood .
Such a level places them in the highest danger of developing pneumonia .
Estimates vary widely as to how many AIDS patients are candidates for the drug .
But the aerosal is also used by people who have contracted the virus that causes AIDS , but who have n't developed the disease .
Separately , Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. said that Lyphomed shareholders had tendered 99.2 % of the company 's outstanding shares under its $ 31.87-a-share buy-out proposal .
The offer values the total company at $ 956.7 million .
Fujisawa said it received 18.4 million shares under the offer , which expired Tuesday .

Francaise des Petroles -LRB- CFP -RRB- said its consolidated net profit surged to 1.709 billion French francs -LRB- $ 267 million -RRB- in the first half of 1989 from 237 million francs -LRB- $ 37 million -RRB- a year earlier and 1.479 billion francs -LRB- $ 231 million -RRB- for all of 1988 .
The state-controlled French oil group said that its first-half profit included a contribution of 1.47 billion francs from an upward adjustment of the value of its oil inventories following a rise in energy prices .
This was in contrast with the comparable year-earlier period , when downward pressure on oil prices lopped 390 million francs from the value of the group 's stocks .
Total 's consolidated revenue climbed 28 % in the first half to 51.131 billion francs from 40.027 billion a year earlier .
The group explained that the advance was fueled by a gain in volume terms that was further boosted by the firm tone of oil prices and the dollar 's advance .

Hooray for your Sept. 20 editorial `` The Privileged Class '' on the increasing acceptance of diverse people and ideas on American campuses .
Our educational environment influences the thinking habits of tomorrow 's workers and thereby our ability to compete in the world marketplace .
The quiet but pervasive suppression of divergent ideas on college campuses has encouraged an emphasis in academia and in the workplace on conformity rather than on contribution as a means to success .
The U.S. cannot hope to reverse its declining leadership role until we resurrect the qualities of Yankee ingenuity and adaptability .
Our education system must serve as a wellspring of intellectual debate and training , not as a means of perpetuating complacency .
To restrict the entrance of unconventional people or ideas to educational discussion is to sabotage our growth , our ability to compete and ultimately our survival .
The penalty of promoting a privileged orientation in academia is the enervation of the American intellect .
